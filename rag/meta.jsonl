{"doc": "AmPac_Bridge_Loans", "page": 1, "text": "Commercial Bridge Loans - AmPac Business Capital Commercial Bridge Loans News & Press Releases Events Success Stories A Strategic Tool for SBA 504 Borrowers and Lenders Small businesses and lenders participating in the SBA 504 loan program are increasingly turning to commercial bridge loans as a vital financing tool. These short-term funding solutions, typically 12 – 36 months are often facilitated by specialized lenders, and serve to provide a short-term solution to borrowers who are in a time crunch on a real estate purchase, completion of property of improvements, or even ground up construction. At the same time, they offer lenders a strategic way to support their clients, mitigate risk, and facilitate smoother transactions by bridging the gap between immediate capital needs, escrow closing deadlines, and permanent SBA-backed financing. Flexible Solutions for SBA 504 Transactions Bridge loans offer businesses financial flexibility in situations where traditional financing is delayed: “Quick Close” Property Acquisitions: Bridge loans enable quick escrow closings, allowing borrowers to seize time-sensitive commercial real estate opportunities Zoning and Permitting Delays: For properties that require rezoning or conditional use permits, bridge loans offer interim financing while these processes are completed. Funding Construction and Improvements: Bridge loans finance property improvements or construction projects when traditional lenders are unable to provide an immediate construction loan. Once the project is complete, the SBA 504 loan serves as the permanent solution. Lenders can support clients while mitigating risk, and businesses gain access to long-term financing with favorable terms, including repayment periods of up to 25 years, below-market fixed interest rates, and reduced equity contributions. Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Benefits While bridge loans provide significant advantages, businesses must carefully evaluate their financial position and repayment strategy. Interest rates on these loans are typically higher than traditional bank loans, so a clear plan for transitioning to permanent financing is essential. Working with experienced lenders who understand the SBA 504 program can help businesses navigate the complexities of bridge financing. These lenders can structure loans to align with SBA requirements, ensuring a smooth transition once the long-term loan is secured. Qualifying for a Bridge Loan To be eligible for a bridge loan that will later be replaced by permanent SBA 504 financing, borrowers must meet specific criteria: The bridge loan term must not exceed three years. Preferably, interest only payments during the term of the loan. Detailed records of invoices and payments for all project costs must be maintained for the planned take out of the bridge loan. The project must align with SBA 504 eligibility requirements, including business size, net worth, and income qualifications. The Future of Bridge Financing in the SBA 504 Ecosystem As more businesses recognize the advantages of bridge loans, some lenders are likely to expand their offerings to meet increasing demand. New lending programs, state-backed initiatives, and private-sector innovations may further enhance accessibility, making it easier for small businesses to secure the capital they need to grow. Borrowers should stay informed about any regulatory changes that may impact bridge loan eligibility, terms, and integration with the SBA 504 program. Working with knowledgeable lenders and financial advisors, like AmPac Business Capital can help businesses stay ahead of these shifts and make informed financing decisions. Commercial bridge loans may serve as a critical financial strategy for businesses pursuing a commercial real estate purchase. By providing immediate access to capital, these loans empower businesses to act quickly on growth opportunities, overcoming financing delays and positioning themselves for long-term success in a competitive market. ← Small Business Remains Purple as Election Dust Settles Empowering Black Small Business Owners: Resources and the Framework of Black History Month → Stay up to date with AmPac News SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER Need Assistance?

Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things, statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the names of the borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan, the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office and be identified as a Freedom of Information request. Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and Debt Collection Improvement Act (31 U.S.C. § 7701 et seq.) Authorities and Purpose for Collecting Information: SBA is collecting the information on this form, including social security numbers and other personal information, to make a character and credit eligibility decision in connection with you or your company’s application for SBA assistance. SBA may also use social security numbers for the purpose of collecting and reporting on any delinquent fees or other amounts owed SBA. Under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. § 7701, the applicant business and any guarantor of the loan are required to provide their social security numbers, or other taxpayer identification numbers, in order to do business with SBA. Failure to provide this information would affect your ability to obtain a 504 loan. For other individuals signing this application, the submission of the social security number is voluntary and failure to provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. However, in evaluating whether the applicant satisfies the criteria for a 504 loan under section 501 et seq. of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. § 695 et seq., SBA considers whether the applicant and each of its Associates possess good character. In making this determination, SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and criminal history if any. SBA is authorized, through section 308(f) of the Small Business Investment Act, to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section 7(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. §636(a)(1)(B). In addition, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Small Business Investment Act, see 15 U.S.C. §687b(a). In conducting the criminal background check, SBA also uses your social security number to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier. This use is permitted under Executive Order 9397. Routine Uses: Some of the information collected may be checked against criminal history indices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When the information collected indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local, or foreign, charged with responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. See SBA’s Privacy Act System of Records, at 74 Fed. Reg. 14890 (2009) (as amended from time to time) for other published routine uses for the collected information.", "id": "Form_1244_6_803809191", "file": "Form_1244.pdf", "title": "Form_1244", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. § 3401 et seq.) – As required by the Right of Financial Privacy Act of 1978, SBA provides this notice of SBA's right to access financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with you or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guarantee. The law provides that SBA shall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in the form of a Government loan or loan guaranty agreement. SBA is required to provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which no further certification is required for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved loan or loan guaranty agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement. The law also authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in an application for a loan, or concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan or loan guarantee or to collect on a defaulted loan or loan guarantee. No other transfer of your financial records to another Government authority will be permitted by SBA except as required or permitted by law. Debt Collection Act of 1982 and Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. § 5514 note and 31 U.S.C. § 3701 et seq.) – These laws require SBA to aggressively collect any loan or other payments which become delinquent. SBA must obtain your taxpayer identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may take one or more of the following actions: • Report the status of your loan(s) or other debt owed to SBA to credit bureaus • Hire a collection agency to collect your loan or other delinquent debt • Offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government • Suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government • Refer your loan or other delinquent debt to the Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation • Foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments • If you default on an SBA loan and fail to fully reimburse SBA for any resulting loss, refer you to the computer database of delinquent Federal debtors maintained by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or other Federal agency, which may disqualify you from receiving financial assistance from other Federal agencies. In addition, unless SBA is reimbursed in full for the loss, you will not eligible for additional SBA financial assistance. Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. § 4012a) – Under this Act, and its implementing regulations, SBA is prohibited from providing financial assistance in a designated floodplain unless Federal flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the Applicant ineligible for any future financial assistance from SBA under any program, including disaster assistance.

CDCs and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) must use this checklist for all 504 debenture closings. General Instructions: 1. CDCs must submit a copy of this Checklist with copies of closing package in the order set forth on the Checklist. 2. CDCs using a Designated Attorney must submit only the first 8 documents on the Checklist for SBA review. 3. CDCs not using a designated attorney must submit copies of all 13 documents on the Checklist for SBA review. 4. In the column labeled “CDC,” the CDC must check off each document the CDC has submitted in the closing package attached to this Checklist. SBA will check the column labeled “SBA” when reviewing the debenture closing package. 5. After debenture sale, CDC must prepare a collateral file containing all the original documents along with copies of the Servicing Agent Agreement and Debenture listed on the Checklist sent with the closing package, and use a copy of the Checklist as the collateral listing. Immediately after the debenture sale, SBA will transfer the loan file to the Commercial Loan Servicing Center (CLSC) to which the loan is assigned (either the Fresno CLSC or the Little Rock CLSC). Immediately after the CDC has received and compiled all final collateral documents, it must send to the appropriate CLSC the complete set of these documents. The CDC may send multiple post-closing packages to the CLSC if necessary, but the CDC must send the first set of documents by no later than 30 days after the debenture sale date. Consult “Lender and Development Company Loan Programs” SOP 50 10, for complete instructions and guidance on the CDC’s responsibilities after debenture sale. Specific Instructions on Completing Checklist: A. Information Grid: CDC must fill out all spaces in the information grid at the top of the Checklist. The information will come from the Authorization for Debenture Guarantee (Authorization) or modifications to the Authorization from the time of approval to the time of debenture closing. At debenture closing, SBA checks the SBA loan name, Borrower and Operating Company name, loan amount, and loan number in its database to ensure this information matches the closing documents and the Authorization. If the information is inconsistent, the CDC must request an appropriate modification to the Authorization. SBA’s Central Servicing Agent also checks the SBA loan name and debenture amount in SBA’s database and will require changes if inconsistencies exist. If the Authorization will expire before the debenture sale date, the CDC must request an extension of the Authorization past the applicable debenture sale date and notify SBA in writing so SBA can enter the extension into SBA’s database. 1.

While this may not immediately make sense, there is actually a simple reason for it… Despite a lot of misconceptions, money for SBA’s 504 Loans does not actually come directly from the SBA. Instead, all 504 loans being funded in any given month are combined into what’s called a debenture pool, which is then marketed, priced, and sold to private investors. SBA has contracts with major /f_inancial institutions to handle the technical aspects of the sale process. Once an agreement is reached with the Underwriters on the sale price of the debentures, the rate of your loan is determined. Interest rates on 504 loans are pegged to an increment above the current market rate for /f_ive-year and ten-year U.S. T reasury issues with maturity options of 10-, 20-, and 25 years. Once set, the rate on the 504 loan is /f_ixed for the life of the loan. Fees associated with administering 504 Loans are added to the debenture rate, and the total is known as the eﬀective, or “all-in” rate. Keep in mind...all SBA 504 loans are funded using the same market sale process, so interest rates in any given month are the same nationwide…regardless of CDC.

Why Growth Corp? 10 Y E A R S 20 Y E A R S 25 Y E A R S SBA 504 Loans Feature LONG/hyphen.capTERM FIXED RATES... Is Interim Financing Necessary? Usually, yes, because there is often a delay between the closing and the funding of an SBA 504 loan. Since the 504 loan is funded through a bond sale after the closing has taken place, the documentation of project completion must /f_irst be sent to the SBA District Oﬃce for submission in the next available bond pool. Based on the date of closing and the submission schedule of the District Oﬃce, the time period could be as little as 5 weeks or up to two or three months, especially for 10 year 504 loans that only have debenture sales every-other month. In most cases, the bank involved in the project provides an interim loan and handles the disbursement of those funds for the project. /T_he bank also typically waits until the SBA has approved the 504 loan and issues a Debenture Authorization before they close on their interim loan. Once the 504 loan funds, the money is wired to the bank (or non-bank interim lender) to pay oﬀ the principal amount of the interim loan. /T_he length of the interim /f_inancing depends on the nature of the project.

Due to its importance, lessons learned from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and SBA’s need to control both speed and certainty, SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility of the Applicant for all eligibility requirements stated in Section A, Chapter 1, using SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework. SBA learned critical lessons from PPP that the Agency is leveraging moving forward, including: • Modern applications must use technology to validate Applicant data through real time third party databases to protect against fraud, identity theft, and ineligibility. The scale of America’s small business access to capital need calls for solutions resilient enough to support an estimated 33 million small businesses that compete in a global marketplace that moves at the pace of a click. • SBA Lenders can provide our nation’s small businesses with fast, profitable, and critical capital using simple, tech enabled processes if they can be completely confident that their loan guarantee would not be repaired or denied—as they were thanks to bipartisan legislation for PPP. • The American taxpayer should be able to trust that program eligibility is validated in real time prior to funds being disbursed; and not be told it was ever possible to police fraud, waste and abuse post-disbursement. Moving forward, with respect to Applicant eligibility requirements contained in Section A, Chapter 1, an SBA Lender processing a loan under delegated authority may now accept as true the information provided by the Applicant; and if the Applicant eligibility information and certification of same is determined to be invalid at any time over the loan life cycle, for 7(a), SBA will not use this as the basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request, and for 504, it will not impact the debenture guaranty. However, in all cases, SBA Lenders must not submit an application that the SBA Lender knows is not eligible, regardless of the Applicant’s certification. SBA will take on the responsibility for verification of the Applicant eligibility requirements contained in Section A, Chapter 1, using SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework, which uses processes in place across the financial services industry. SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework is available through a network of third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) databases and solutions. Applicant unique identifiers, together with Application Program Interface (“API”), enable SBA, like many financial service firms, to validate identification information, financial data, and eligibility criteria through access to financial documents and data from source of truth. SBA Lenders have the ability to conduct a pre-check in E-Tran before submitting a loan application to determine whether SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework flags any compliance check error codes for the Applicant. SBA Lenders will not be able to clear codes during a pre-check. Prior to receiving an SBA loan number, all SBA Lenders must digitally submit a complete application and the loan terms and conditions to SBA, which will screen for the eligibility", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_13_1971954", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

SBA will determine whether the Applicant meets the eligibility requirements in Section A, Chapter 1, by requiring the Applicant to certify to certain program eligibility requirements and validating those certifications through SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework. When the SBA Lender enters the complete application and loan terms and conditions into E- Tran, and/or when the SBA Lender requests a pre-check, SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework will conduct compliance checks for the items in this chapter (e.g., the Applicant is an operating business, organized for profit, located in the U.S., is small in accordance with SBA size standards, and is not one of the ineligible businesses in 13 CFR § 120.110 and 31 CFR § 285.13, etc.). If the Risk Mitigation Framework returns a compliance check error code for the Applicant, the SBA Lender will receive a notification that it must clear the code in order to proceed (regardless of whether the SBA Lender is processing the loan via delegated or non-delegated authority). Once the code is cleared and SBA has issued an SBA loan number, the SBA Lender may continue processing the loan. Eligibility requirements that will be verified by SBA’s Risk Mitigation Framework for all Applicants for 7(a) and 504 loans are discussed below. A. APPLICANT CERTIFICATION The Applicant must sign and execute a borrower application form that contains a certification regarding the Applicant’s eligibility. The application form for 7(a) is SBA Form 1919, “Borrower Information Form”, and for 504 is SBA Form 1244, “Application for Section 504 Loans.” SBA or an SBA Lender processing a loan under delegated authority may accept as true the Applicant is eligible as certified. If the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, for 7(a), SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request and for 504, it will not impact the debenture guaranty. The Applicant must certify to the following: 1. The Applicant complies with all Loan Program Requirements as defined in 13 CFR § 120.10, including but not limited to requirements in 13 CFR §§ 120.100, 120.110 , 121.301, and 31 CFR § 285.13. The Applicant further certifies that the applicant business is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by persons who are citizens of the U.S. or are Lawful Permanent Residents and that all SBA loan proceeds will be used in accordance with Loan Program Requirements. SBA or the SBA Lender may request additional information to determine that an Applicant fulfills any eligibility requirement. By signing the application, the Applicant has certified that it fulfills all eligibility requirements. 2. The information provided in the application and the information provided in all supporting documents and forms is true and accurate in all material respects. The Applicant understands that knowingly making a false statement to obtain a guaranteed loan from SBA is punishable under the law, including under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 3571 by imprisonment of not more than five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000; under 15 U.S.C. 645 by imprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more than $5,000; and, if submitted to a federally insured institution, under 18 U.S.C. 1014 by imprisonment of not more than thirty years and/or a fine of not more than $1,000,000.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_14_657158734", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

OPERATING BUSINESS 120.100(a) The Applicant must be an Operating Business (except for Eligible Passive Companies (EPCs)). C. ORGANIZED FOR PROFIT 120.100(b) The Applicant must be organized for Profit. D. LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES 120.100(c) The Applicant must be located in the United States. If an Applicant has international operations, the loan proceeds must be used exclusively for the benefit of the domestic operations. E. SMALL UNDER SBA SIZE REQUIREMENTS 120.100(d) The Applicant must be small under SBA Size Requirements (13 CFR Part 121) (including affiliates). The Applicant may qualify under either the industry small business size standards or the alternative size standard. 1. Size Standards “Industry Size Standard.” The Applicant alone (without affiliates) must not exceed the small business size standard for the industry in which the Applicant is primarily engaged, and the Applicant when combined with its affiliates, must not exceed the size standard designated for either the primary industry (defined in 13 CFR § 121.107) of the Applicant alone or the primary industry of the Applicant and its affiliates, whichever is higher. SBA calculates annual receipts for both the Applicant and its affiliates based on Federal tax returns ( 13 CFR § 121.104). The table of size standards is found at 13 CFR § 121.201. “Alternative Size Standard.” The Applicant (including affiliates) must meet the following (Small Business Act, § 3(a)(5)): i. The maximum tangible net worth may not exceed $15 million; and ii. The average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the 2 full fiscal years before the application date may not exceed $5.0 million. The applicable size standards are increased by 25 percent when the Applicant agrees to use all of the financial assistance within a labor surplus area (labor surplus areas are designated by the Department of Labor). ( 13 CFR § 121.301(e)) For loans structured with an EPC and OC, only the OC is examined for size and affiliation. However, in accordance with 13 CFR § 120.151, the amount of any loan received by an EPC applies to the loan limit of both the EPC and the OC. 2. When Applicant size is determined (13 CFR § 121.302) The size of an Applicant for SBA financial assistance is determined as of the date the application is accepted for processing by SBA. Changes in the size of the business subsequent to that date will not disqualify an Applicant for assistance.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_15_100500550", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

For 504, if the Applicant is using the proposed loan proceeds to finance the acquisition of assets in conjunction with a change of ownership, the sizes of the two businesses are combined to determine if the Applicant meets small business size standards. For applications processed under an SBA Lender’s delegated authority (PLP, SBA Express, Export Express, PLP-EWCP, and PCLP CDC), the size of the small business is determined as of the date of approval of the loan by the SBA Lender. 3. Formal size determinations Prior to denial of eligibility based on size, a formal size determination may be requested by an Applicant or the SBA official with authority to take final action on the assistance requested. ( 13 CFR § 121.1001(b)(1)) The SBA official may also request a determination of whether affiliation exists between an Applicant for financial assistance and one or more other entities to determine whether the Applicant, together with any affiliates, would exceed the maximum loan amount and maximum guaranty amount set out in 13 CFR § 120.151. The request for a size or affiliation determination must be made to the Government Contracting Area Director serving the area in which the headquarters of the Applicant is located, regardless of the location of the parent company or affiliates. 4. Affiliation 13 CFR 121.301 The Small Business Act defines a small business concern as one which is independently owned and operated, and which is not dominant in its field of operation. SBA interprets this statutory definition to require, in certain circumstances, the inclusion of other entities (“Affiliates”) owned by the applicant or an owner of the applicant in determining the size of the applicant. On April 10, 2023, SBA published the Final Rule on Affiliation and Lending Criteria for the SBA Business Loan Programs (88 FR 21074 , effective May 11, 2023). This rule removed the principle of control, both affirmative and negative control, as establishing affiliation between entities. Accordingly, franchise, license or similar agreements no longer need to be reviewed for control. The following principles apply for the Business Loan, Disaster Loan, and Surety Bond Guarantee Programs: Affiliation Based on Ownership Note: NAICS codes can be found at 13 CFR § 121.201, and a searchable database of industries and NAICS codes is located at naics.com. i. When the Applicant owns more than 50 percent of another business, the Applicant and the other business are affiliated.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_16_395176363", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

When a business owns more than 50 percent of an Applicant, the business that owns the Applicant is affiliated with the Applicant. Additionally, if the business entity owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant also owns more than 50 percent of another business that operates in the same 3- digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, then the business entity owner, the other business and the Applicant are all affiliated. iii. When an individual owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant and the individual also owns more than 50 percent of another business entity that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the individual owner’s other business entity are affiliated. iv. When the Applicant does not have an owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant, if an owner of 20 percent or more of the Applicant is a business that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the owner are affiliated. v. When the Applicant does not have an owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant, if an owner of 20 percent or more of the Applicant also owns more than 50 percent of another business entity that operates in the same 3- digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the owner’s other business entity are affiliated. vi. Ownership interests of spouses and minor children must be combined when determining amount of ownership interest. Ownership interests are not combined when spouses and minor children have individual ownership interests in different businesses. vii. When determining the percentage of ownership that an individual owns in a business, SBA considers the pro rata ownership of entities. For example, John Smith, Jane Doe, and Jane Doe, Inc., each own an interest in the Applicant. Jane Doe owns 15 percent of the Applicant, and she also owns 100 percent of Jane Doe, Inc. Jane Doe, Inc. owns 50 percent of the Applicant. SBA considers Jane Doe to own 65 percent of the Applicant. Affiliation Based on Stock Options, Convertible Securities, and Agreements to Merge i. For purposes of this subparagraph, SBA considers stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) to have a present effect on the ownership of the entity. SBA treats such options, convertible securities, and agreements as though the rights granted have been exercised. ii. Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not considered “agreements in principle” and are thus not given present effect. iii.

SBA will not give present effect to individuals', concerns', or other entities' ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest to avoid a finding of affiliation. Determining the Concern's Size i. In determining the concern's size, SBA counts the receipts, employees (see § 121.201), or the alternate size standard (if applicable) of the concern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates, regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit. ii. Exceptions to Affiliation - For exceptions to affiliation, see § 121.103(b). F.

The processing procedures and the terms and conditions will vary depending upon the status of the owners as assigned by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). SBA requires all participating SBA Lenders, including SBLCs, to comply with the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations for Customer Identification Programs (CIP) for banks, savings associations, credit unions, and certain non-federally-regulated banks found at 31 CFR § 1020.220.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_19_827850021", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Under these circumstances, it is acceptable to SBA if a CDC’s CIP states that the CDC will rely on the Third Party Lender to verify the identity of the SBA Applicant. The CDC has the option of performing its own verification of the identity of the SBA Applicant even if a Third Party Lender has already complied with 31 CFR § 1020.220. If the Third Party Lender has not submitted the requisite annual certification to the CDC, the CDC must perform its own verification of identity. 1. Businesses owned by Naturalized Citizens are eligible and the naturalized citizens are not subject to any special restrictions or requirements. No further verification of status is required if an individual is reflected as a U.S. Citizen on the SBA application. 2. Businesses owned by Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) are eligible. LPRs are persons who may live and work in the U.S. for life unless their status is revoked through an administrative hearing. The USCIS Form I-551 (551), Lawful Permanent Resident Card, commonly referred to as the “green card,” is evidence of LPR status. USCIS has two versions of the 551: i. Resident Alien Card (issued through 1997); and ii. Permanent Resident Card. (This is the most recent version and has been issued since 1997.) iii. Because it can take up to a year for a newly arrived immigrant to receive a 551, new immigrants are issued an immigrant visa with a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) stamp evidencing their lawful permanent residence for a full year from the date the new immigrant entered the U.S. This visa with CBP stamp serves as evidence of LPR status, so long as the visa is not expired. Since 1997, USCIS has issued the 551 with a 10-year validity, at which time it expires and must be renewed. A 551 issued between 1979 and August 1989, however, does not have an expiration date. Replacing the 551 may be necessary if the 551 is lost, the individual changes his/her name, etc. Replacement of the 551 may take more than a year. The expiration of the immigrant’s 551 does not affect the LPR status of the immigrant. Acceptable forms of evidence when the 551 has been submitted to USCIS for replacement or renewal upon expiration include the following: i. Temporary I-551 stamps. A temporary stamp, issued by USCIS to replace lost or expiring 551s, either on the immigrant’s unexpired foreign passport (that reads “Upon endorsement, serves as temporary I-551 evidencing permanent residency for 1 year”), or in cases where there is no passport or it is expired, on Form I-94 with passport photo (that reads “Processed for I-551 – Temporary Evidence of Lawful Permanent Residence”);", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_20_787116327", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

USCIS Form I-327, “Re-entry Permit,” issued to LPRs in lieu of a visa, which is valid for only 2 years (the I-327 is issued for LPRs who need to be overseas for longer than 1 year); or iii. USCIS Form I-797, Notice of Action. Aliens with Conditional LPR status (those who married a U.S. citizen and were married for less than 2 years at the time of being granted LPR status) must file Form I-751 to remove conditional status within 90 days of their 551 expiration. LPRs awaiting approval of their I-751 should be issued Form I-797, which along with the expired 551, is proof of current LPR status. Please note that there are numerous types of Form I-797 (e.g., I-797A, I-797-B, I-797C, etc.). For purposes of removing conditional status, only I-797 is acceptable. SBA requires the 551 or an acceptable substitute be current at the time it is submitted with an application, or it will be returned and not processed.

CREDIT NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE (15 USC 636(a)(1)(A) and 13 CFR § 120.101) On April 21, 2014, the Final Rule on 504 and 7(a) Loan Programs Updates 79 FR 15641 eliminating the personal resources test to improve access to its two flagship business lending programs - the 504 Loan Program and the 7(a) Loan Program – became effective. This rule enhanced job creation through increasing eligibility for loans under SBA's business loan programs. Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act requires that SBA ensure reasonable assurance of repayment from the cashflow of the business. The Final Rule and Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act does not preclude personal liquidity of the Applicant owners being available as a secondary form of repayment. Therefore, personal resources from owners enhance SBA’s ability to mitigate loan losses to the taxpayer due to the personal guaranty required of all owners of the small business Applicant. The plain text of the Credit Not Available Elsewhere test does not require a personal resource test. Per 13 CFR § 120.101 , “SBA provides business loan assistance only to applicants for whom the desired credit is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from non-Federal, non-State, and non-local government sources. Accordingly, SBA requires the Lender or CDC to certify or otherwise show that the desired credit is unavailable to the applicant on reasonable terms and conditions from non-Federal, non-State, and non-local government sources without SBA assistance, taking into consideration factors associated with conventional lending practices, including: The business industry of the loan applicant; whether the loan applicant has been in operation two years or less; the adequacy of collateral available to secure the loan; the loan term necessary to reasonably assure repayment of the loan from actual or projected business cash flow; and any other factor relating to the particular loan application that cannot be overcome except through obtaining a Federal loan guarantee under prudent lending standards. Submission of an application to SBA by a Lender or CDC constitutes certification by the Lender or CDC that it has examined the availability of credit to the applicant, has based its certification upon that examination, and has substantiation in its file to support the certification.”", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_23_68614606", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

In addition, SBA acknowledges that the certification of credit not available elsewhere for the reasons enumerated in the regulation constitutes on its face that the Lender or CDC has examined the availability of credit to the applicant, has based its certification upon that examination, and has substantiation in its file to support the certification. 1. The SBA Lender must certify and indicate that the Applicant does not have the ability to obtain some or all of the requested loan funds on reasonable terms from non-Federal, non- State, or non-local government sources, including from the SBA Lender or Third Party Lender, without SBA assistance. 2. Acceptable factors that support SBA Lender certification and demonstrate an identifiable weakness in the credit or exceed policy limits of the SBA Lender or the Third Party Lender include, among others: The business needs a longer maturity than the SBA Lender’s/Third Party Lender’s policy permits to reasonably assure the ability of the loan applicant to repay the debt from the actual or projected cash flow of the business (for example, the business needs a loan that is not on a demand basis); The requested loan exceeds the SBA Lender’s/Third Party Lender’s policy limit regarding the amount that it can lend to one customer; The collateral does not meet the SBA Lender’s/Third Party Lender’s policy requirements; The SBA Lender’s/Third Party Lender’s policy normally does not allow loans to new businesses (e.g., a business that has been in operation for a period of not more than 2 years) or businesses in the Applicant’s industry; Any other factors relating to the particular credit that, in the SBA Lender’s/Third Party Lender’s opinion, cannot be overcome except for the guaranty. Examples of “other factors” may include business and personal credit history, management experience, leverage ratio, global cashflow, and loan size relative to the age of the business. The SBA Lender may cite the Applicant’s inability to meet the SBA Lender’s or Third Party Lender’s conventional credit score policy as the sole reason that credit is not available elsewhere. SBA encourages SBA Lenders to expedite processing of SBA loans by documenting the justification for credit not available elsewhere with an automated process where the SBA Lender selects one of the designated categories outlined in the regulation. There is no requirement for written justification in the SBA Lender’s credit memorandum beyond simply indicating one or more reasons from a list of the acceptable factors that support the SBA Lender’s certification.

(13 CFR § 120.130(d)) Because the EPC rule is an exception, the EPC and the OC must comply with all of the conditions in 13 CFR § 120.111 and each condition is interpreted strictly. If all conditions are not complied with, in the event of default on a 7(a) loan, SBA may deny liability on the guaranty. In 504, SBA may pursue a CDC Recovery Claim under 13 CFR § 120.938 in the case of fraud, negligence, or misrepresentation by the CDC. An Eligible Passive Company (EPC) must use loan proceeds only to acquire or lease, and/or improve or renovate, real or personal property (including eligible refinancing), that it leases to one or more Operating Companies (OCs) for conducting the OC's business, or to finance a change of ownership between the existing owners of the EPC. An EPC may only use loan proceeds to finance a change of ownership between existing owners of the EPC when the real estate or personal property has been held by the selling owner(s) for at least 36 months. For specific information on change of ownership loans with an EPC/OC structure: • For 7(a), see the eligible uses of proceeds section of each delivery method chapter. Note, change of ownership is not an eligible use of proceeds for the CAPLines and EWCP delivery methods, or for revolving facilities. • For 504, see Section C, Ch. 1, Para. C.13, Change of Ownership for the circumstances under which change of ownership is permitted. Note: See Para. C.13.a.iii. of such Section for important restrictions that apply if using a 504 loan to finance a change of ownership between existing owners of the EPC. With the exception of a change of ownership between existing owners of the EPC, an EPC may not use loan proceeds to acquire a business, acquire stock in a business or any intangible assets of a business, or to refinance debt that was incurred for those purposes. In addition, when the EPC and OC(s) are co-borrowers: • A 7(a) loan may include loan proceeds for working capital and/or the purchase of other assets, including intangible assets for the OC’s use; and • A 504 loan may include loan proceeds for the purchase of fixed assets to be owned by the OC(s). An EPC can take any legal form or ownership structure (e.g., corporation, partnership, LLC, sole proprietor, tenancy in common, etc.) A tenancy in common is a form of legal ownership and does not create a new or separate legal entity. There may be several individuals or entities in a tenancy in common, but the tenancy in common is considered one EPC. The loan documents must be signed by all of the members of the tenancy in common. Multiple OCs can be separately owned, however, multiple EPCs in one transaction are not permitted. An EPC may own several unique properties that it leases to the same OC(s).

The EPC (with the exception of a trust) and the OC(s) each must be small under the appropriate size standard of 13 CFR Part 121; iv. The EPC must lease the project property directly to the OC(s); and a) Obtain a fully executed written lease; b) The lease must be subordinated to the SBA’s mortgage, trust deed lien, or security interest on the property (Note: This is not the same as a Landlord’s Waiver); c) The lease must have a term, including options to renew exercisable solely by the OC(s), at least equal to the term of the loan; d) The EPC (as landlord) must furnish as collateral for the loan an assignment of all rents paid under the lease. An assignment of the lease is only required when necessary to perfect the assignment of rents under applicable law, or to enable the SBA Lender to exercise the tenant’s rights upon default; e) The rent or lease payments cannot exceed the amount necessary to make the loan payment to the Lender and an additional amount to cover the EPC’s direct expenses of holding the property, such as routine maintenance, utility expenses, insurance, and property taxes. For 504 loans, loan payments to the SBA, the Third Party Lender, and if applicable, to a lender authorized by SBA to provide the Borrower's contribution, are included in the calculation of “loan payment to the Lender.” Rent or lease payments cannot include amounts for accelerated payments on the Third Party Loan; f) When calculating repayment ability, the SBA Lender must consider whether the OC’s cash flow will be sufficient to cover the loan payment (for 504 loans, including the loan payment to the Third Party Lender), in addition to the expenses of holding the property including the payment of routine maintenance, property taxes, utility expenses, insurance, and all other ongoing expenses; g) The OC(s) must lease 100% of the property from the EPC, but it can sublease a portion of the property under the rules governing occupancy requirements with which all SBA Borrowers must comply (see Chapter 3, Para. C, Occupancy and Leasing Requirements of this Section for more information); h) If, in acquiring the property, the EPC becomes the beneficiary or owner of the rights to an existing mineral lease on the property, the EPC must assign its interest in the lease (together with its rights to all rental, mineral, royalty, bonus, or similar lease payments that might accrue by virtue of the existing mineral (oil and gas) lease) to the OC(s); and any such assignment must be subordinated to all Deeds of Trust or", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_26_6756262", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The OC(s) must be a guarantor or a co-Borrower on the loan. a) Each holder of an ownership interest constituting at least 20% of either the EPC or the OC(s) must guarantee the loan (if the holder is a trust, then the Trustee shall execute the guarantee on behalf of the trust). b) Each spouse owning less than 20% of an EPC or OC must personally guarantee the loan in full when the combined ownership interest of both spouses and minor children is 20% or more. c) For a non-owner spouse, the SBA Lender must require the signature of the spouse on the appropriate collateral documents. The spouse's guaranty secured by jointly held collateral will be limited to the spouse's interest in the collateral. d) If a person has executed the Note as a Borrower in an individual capacity, that person does not also have to execute a personal guaranty. e) When deemed necessary for credit or other reasons, SBA or, for a loan processed under an SBA Lender’s delegated authority, the SBA Lender, may require other appropriate individuals or entities to provide full or limited guaranties of the loan without regard to the percentage of their ownership interests, if any. f) The OC(s) must be a co-Borrower if it receives any proceeds or if proceeds will be used to purchase any assets for the OC(s) use. vii. The amount of any loan received by an EPC applies to the loan limit of both the EPC and the OC. Conditions that apply when the EPC is owned in whole or in part by a trust. i. The eligibility status of the Trustor will determine trust eligibility. ii. All donors to the trust will be deemed to have Trustor status for eligibility purposes. iii. The Trustee must warrant and certify that the trust will not be revoked or substantially amended for the term of the loan without the prior written consent of SBA. iv. The Trustor must guarantee the loan. a) If an Employee Stock Ownership Plan trust agreement prohibits it from being a guarantor or co-Borrower, then it cannot use the EPC form of borrowing. b) Beneficiaries that exercise any control over the actions of the trust also must guarantee the loan.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_27_695528082", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Trustee shall certify in writing to SBA, or to the SBA Lender processing a loan under its delegated authority, that: a) The Trustee has authority to act; b) The trust has authority to borrow funds, pledge trust assets, and lease the property to the OC(s); c) The Trustee has provided accurate, pertinent language from the trust agreement confirming the above; and d) The Trustee has provided SBA or the SBA Lender processing a loan under its delegated authority with a true and complete list of all trustors and donors and will provide an updated list to SBA or the SBA Lender processing a loan under its delegated authority any time the list changes. vi. The trust itself does not have to be small by SBA size standards. Size Determinations under the EPC rule. i. If the EPC and the OC(s) are affiliated, the two companies are combined for determining size. a) If there is only one OC, use the OC’s NAICS code. b) If there are multiple, unaffiliated OCs, use the NAICS code of the OC that generates the most revenue. Note: Each OC must be small based on its own NAICS code. c) If the multiple OCs are affiliated, then use the rules detailed in 13 CFR §121.107 for determining the primary industry of affiliated businesses. The NAICS Code of the primary industry of the OC shall be the identifying NAICS Code. ii. If the EPC and the OC(s) are not affiliated, each entity must be small under the size requirement for its particular industry. The existence of a lease between the EPC and the OC(s) does not, in and of itself, create an affiliation, even if the EPC and OC(s) are co-Borrowers. When sending data to SBA, use the same NAICS Code that was used to determine size for the Applicant. Submission of Financial Statements by the EPC and the OC(s): i. The EPC and each OC must submit Financial Statements. The OC’s statements are subject to tax verification. ii. The regular requirement for an Aging of receivables and payables is waived for EPCs. 2. Loans to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) For 7(a) loans only: SBA may assist a qualified employee trust (or equivalent trust) that meets the requirements and conditions for an ESOP prescribed in all applicable IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor regulations. 13 CFR §§ 120.350 - 120.354", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_28_406642075", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Purchasing a controlling interest (at least 51 percent) in the employer small business; or ii. Purchasing qualified employer securities. The employer small business may use the funds received from the purchase of the qualified employer securities for any general 7(a) purpose. iii. In the case of either a.i. or a.ii. above, the small business concern must be a co-borrower on the 7(a) loan. SBA may guarantee a 7(a) loan to an eligible employer small business for the sole purpose of making a loan to a qualified employee trust (ESOP) that results in the qualified employee trust owning at least 51 percent of the employer small business concern. Transaction costs associated with the purchase of the controlling interest by the ESOP or equivalent trust may be included in the use of proceeds, but any transaction costs associated with setting up the ESOP may not be included in the use of proceeds. If the seller of the employer small business remains as a partial owner, the seller must provide a full, unlimited guarantee regardless of percentage of ownership. Note: This is a statutory requirement and cannot be waived. Lenders may process loans to an ESOP or to an eligible small business owned or controlled by an ESOP under delegated authority. However, Lenders are reminded that regardless of processing method (delegated or non-delegated) the ESOP must be in compliance with IRS, Treasury, and the Department of Labor requirements. The IRS prohibits ESOPs from guarantying a loan; therefore, SBA does not require the ESOP to guarantee the loan. In addition, members of the ESOP are not required to personally guarantee the loan. All owners of the Applicant who hold an ownership interest in the small business outside the ESOP are subject to SBA’s guaranty requirements. (See Ch. 5, Para. A, Guaranties, of this Section for more information.) The application cannot be structured as an EPC/OC. (13 CFR § 120.111(a)(6)) SBA regulations require each 20% or more owner of the EPC and each 20% or more owner of the OC to guarantee the loan, and the regulation does not provide for an exception. Prior to first disbursement, the Lender must obtain documentation that the ESOP or equivalent trust meets the requirements of all applicable IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor regulations. Loans to ESOPs for the purpose of purchasing a controlling interest (at least 51 percent) in the employer small business are not subject to the requirement for equity injection. 3.

SBA Lenders may not process loans to a cooperative or to an eligible small business owned or controlled by a cooperative under delegated authority. Each loan must be guaranteed by at least one individual or entity. (See Ch. 5, Para. A, Guaranties, of this Section for more information.) For 7(a) only: SBA may guarantee a loan to a cooperative to purchase a controlling interest (51% or more) in the employer small business. Any transaction costs associated with the purchase of the controlling interest, but not costs associated with setting up the cooperative, may be included in the use of proceeds. The SBA Lender must submit supporting organizational documents and agreements as applicable with the loan application depending on the type of cooperative and the purpose of the loan (e.g., a loan to a cooperative to acquire a controlling interest in the employer concern), which may include Cooperative Agreement; Organization documents; Articles of Incorporation/Organization; Bylaws; Operating/Conversion/Redemption/Membership Agreement(s); or any other agreements as necessary. 4. 401(k) Plans Including Rollovers as Business Start-ups (ROBS) Plans A business that is owned in whole or in part by a 401(k) plan (including a Rollovers as Business Startups (ROBS) plan) may be eligible provided the SBA Lender complies with the requirements in this section and the plan complies with all applicable IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor requirements. When evaluating applications involving such businesses, SBA Lenders must consider that a 401(k) plan sponsor’s failure to administer the plan properly may result in plan disqualification and adverse tax consequences to the plan’s sponsor and its participants, which may impact the Borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Applications where the Applicant or any owner (including a corporation formed through a ROBS plan) is a: • Single Employer Plan, including ROBS plans, may be processed under an SBA Lender’s delegated authority if the only investment held by the 401(k) plan at the time of application is the equity in the Applicant business. Note: Any subsequent contributions required under IRS and/or Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations are permitted. • Multiple-Employer Plan, (i.e., plans that hold in trust the assets of other businesses), including ROBS plans, must be submitted to the SBA processing center under non- delegated processing. NOTE: Size standards and maximum SBA guarantee limits to a Borrower and its affiliates apply to the multiple-employer plan. The SBA Lender must: i.

For more information on collateral: For 7(a), see the collateral section in each delivery method chapter of Section B. For 504, see Section C, Ch. 1, Para. E.2.a., Collateral . iii. The SBA Lender must obtain the following 401(k) plan documentation with the loan application: a) A favorable determination letter from IRS providing advance assurance that the terms of the 401(k) plan satisfies qualification requirements. IRS Publication 794 explains the significance of the favorable determination letter, points out critical areas that may affect the qualified status of a 401(k) plan, and provides general information on the reporting requirements for the 401(k) plan; b) For an existing 401(k) plan, the Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan (e.g., IRS Form 5500, IRS Form 5500-EZ, etc.); c) For a ROBS plan: i) C Corporation formation documents; ii) 401(k) plan adoption documents; iii) Stock purchase agreements; and iv) Related corporate resolutions. SBA loan proceeds may not be used for any 401(k) plan formation costs. Prior to any disbursement of loan proceeds, the SBA Lender must obtain the Borrower’s certification that the Borrower and the 401(k) plan are in compliance with all applicable IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor requirements and that it will comply with all relevant operating and reporting requirements. C. PRIMARY APPLICANT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS VERIFIED BY THE SBA LENDER The following types of businesses are ineligible. The SBA Lender is responsible for determining the Applicant’s business is not ineligible due to the following: 1. Businesses in which an SBA Lender or any of its Associates owns an equity interest, directly or indirectly, are not eligible. The only exception is when the Associate of the Applicant is a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), in which case the requirements of 13 CFR § 120.104 apply. 13 CFR § 120.110(o) 2.

A Borrower may use loan proceeds from any SBA Loan to: Acquire land (by purchase or lease) as part of an eligible project; Improve a site (e.g., grading, streets, parking lots, landscaping) including up to 5 percent for community improvements such as curbs and sidewalks; Purchase one or more existing buildings; Convert, expand, or renovate one or more existing buildings; Construct one or more new buildings; Acquire (by purchase or lease) and install fixed assets (for a 504 loan, these assets must have a useful life of at least 10 years and be at a fixed location, although short-term financing for equipment, furniture, and furnishings may be permitted where essential to and a minor portion of the 504 Project); Finance a Lender’s Other Real Estate Owned (OREO): When loan proceeds will be used to finance the purchase of real estate owned by the 7(a) Lender; or for 504, the Third Party Lender, making the loan, the application must: i. Be submitted to the SBA loan processing center (delegated authority may not be used to process these applications); ii.

If the acquisition of the property was triggered by a business failure at that particular location, the SBA Lender must submit a detailed explanation of why the new Applicant will succeed at that same location; and iv. For 7(a): Identify the SBA Lender’s cost in the real estate. In order to get the full SBA guaranty, the sales price may not exceed the mortgage balance plus care and preservation expenses or the liquidation value, whichever is less.

Occupancy 13 CFR § 120.131 Amount of Rentable Property (based on the total project) that can be leased: When loan proceeds are used to purchase or improve real estate, or when debt secured by real estate is refinanced with loan proceeds: i. For an existing building, the Applicant must occupy 51% of the Rentable Property and may lease to a third party up to 49%; or ii. For new construction, the Applicant must occupy 60% of the Rentable Property, may permanently lease to a third party up to 20% and temporarily lease an additional 20% with the intention of using some of the additional 20% within 3 years and all of it within 10 years. When the real estate is owned by an EPC: i. The EPC must lease 100% of the Rentable Property to an eligible OC(s). ii. For an existing building, the OC(s) must occupy 51% of the Rentable Property and may sublease up to 49%; or iii. For new construction, the OC(s) must occupy 60% of the Rentable Property, may permanently sublease to a third party up to 20% and temporarily sublease an additional 20% with the intention of using some of the additional 20% within 3 years and all of it within 10 years. “Rentable Property” is the total square footage of all buildings or facilities used for business operations ( 13 CFR § 120.10) excluding stairways, elevators, and mechanical areas and including common areas. Rentable Property may also include exterior space (except parking areas) that is actively used in Borrower’s business operations. To determine the occupancy percentage allocated to the Applicant or OC(s), the SBA Lender may include the square footage of all common areas. Circumstances may justify allowing the Applicant a period of time after closing of the SBA Loan to comply with the above occupancy requirements such as when a pre-existing lease may have a few more months to run. In no case may the small business have more than 1 year to meet occupancy requirements. CDCs must not submit a 504 closing package if the Borrower will not be occupying and operating in the required amount of Property after closing and funding. If the Borrower will not be able to meet the occupancy requirements, the CDC must submit in advance and in writing to SLPC a request to extend the period of time necessary for the Borrower to meet occupancy requirements, along with an explanation and any supporting documentation, for SLPC approval. The Borrower may not use loan proceeds to improve or renovate any of the Rentable Property to be subleased to a third party.

Responsibilities When the Borrower is Leasing Space The lease term, including renewal options exercisable only by the Borrower, must equal or exceed the term of the loan. An assignment of lease and Landlord’s waiver should be obtained either when a substantial portion of the loan proceeds are to be used for leasehold improvements or a substantial portion of the collateral consists of leasehold improvements, fixtures, machinery, or equipment that is attached to leased real estate. If the loan proceeds will finance existing or new improvements on a leasehold interest in land, the underlying ground lease must include, at a minimum, detailed clauses addressing the following: i. Tenant's right to encumber leasehold estate; ii. No modification or cancellation of lease without SBA Lender's or assignee's approval; iii. SBA Lender's or assignee's right to: a) Acquire the leasehold at foreclosure sale or by assignment and right to reassign the leasehold estate (along with right to exercise any options) by SBA Lender or successors; lessor may not unreasonably withhold, condition, or delay the reassignment; b) Sublease; c) Share in hazard insurance proceeds resulting from damage to improvements; d) Share in condemnation proceeds; and e) SBA Lender’s or assignee’s rights upon default of the tenant or termination.

Conflicts of Interest: Neither an SBA Lender nor its Associates may have a real or apparent conflict of interest with a small business with which it is dealing or SBA (13 CFR § 120.140 and 13 CFR Part 105). SBA Lenders must exercise care and judgment in determining whether a conflict of interest exists and document the file in detail.

SBA Lenders must submit the statement as a PDF attachment to SNOMemos@sba.gov and receive written clearance from SBA prior to submitting the application to the SBA loan processing center (non-delegated) or processing the application under their delegated authority. SBA Lenders processing a loan under non-delegated procedures must submit a copy of SBA’s written clearance with the application to the SBA loan processing center. ( 13 CFR § 105.301(a)) SBA Lenders processing a loan under delegated procedures must retain SBA’s written clearance in the loan file. SBA will review the statements when conducting lender oversight activities and, for 7(a) loans, the statement must be included in any request for SBA to honor its guaranty in the event of default by the Borrower. B. DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, AND EXCLUSION (SAM.GOV) Individuals and entities suspended, debarred, revoked, or otherwise excluded under the SBA or Government-wide debarment regulations are not permitted to conduct business with SBA. See 2 CFR Part 180, adopted by reference in 2 CFR Part 2700 (SBA Debarment Regulations). SBA Lenders are responsible for consulting the System for Award Management’s Exclusions (SAM Exclusions) or any successor system to determine if any of the following have been suspended, debarred, revoked, or otherwise excluded by SBA or another Federal agency.

Fees the Lender Pays SBA SBA Guaranty Fee (also known as Upfront Fee) and the 7(a) Lender’s Annual Service Fee (also known as the SBA On-Going Guaranty Fee). (13 CFR § 120.220) The 7(a) Lender is responsible for payment to SBA of the Upfront Fee and the Lender’s Annual Service Fee in order to obtain and maintain the SBA guaranty. SBA Guaranty Fee (Upfront Fee). The Upfront Fee is the fee a 7(a) Lender must pay to SBA for each loan guaranteed under the 7(a) program. The 7(a) Lender is permitted to pass the cost of the Upfront Fee to the Borrower. The Agency automatically calculates the Upfront Fee for each individual loan. This calculation is modified in SBA’s loan accounting system and E-Tran to include changes to the fee that are necessary due to other loans approved within the past 90 days. Short-term loans are not included", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_41_537339363", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

For more information, see below or contact the processing center or Lead District Office. The Borrower may use loan proceeds to pay the Upfront Fee; however, the first disbursement may not be made primarily for the purpose of paying the Upfront Fee. If the Borrower plans to use loan proceeds to pay the Upfront Fee, the E-Tran terms and conditions must include a Use of Proceeds category for this purpose. Note: When an escrow closing is used, the 7(a) Lender may charge the Borrower the Upfront Fee only when all loan funds have been disbursed to the Borrower from the escrow account. i. Calculation of the Upfront Fee. The total loan amount determines the percentage that is used to calculate this fee. However, the Upfront Fee is based on the guaranteed portion of the loan and not the total loan amount. The chart below describes the applicable fees. MAXIMUM UPFRONT FEE CHART (See Note 1) Gross Loan Size Maximum Fees (See Note 1) Loans of $150,000 or less (Maturity more than 12 months) (See Note 2) 2% of guaranteed portion 7(a) Lender is authorized to retain 25% of the fee. $150,001 to $700,000 (Maturity more than 12 months) 3% of guaranteed portion $700,001 to $5,000,000 (Maturity more than 12 months) (See Note 3) 3.5% of guaranteed portion up to $1,000,000 PLUS 3.75% of the guaranteed portion over $1,000,000 Short-Term Loans – up to $5 million (Maturity of 12 months or less) 0.25% of the guaranteed portion Note 1: The above table describes the maximum Upfront Fees as authorized by 13 CFR § 120.220. However, SBA may announce temporary changes for a specific fiscal year through an Information Notice. Note 2: For example, the Upfront Fee on a $100,000 loan with an 85% guaranty would be 2% of $85,000 or $1,700, of which the 7(a) Lender may retain $425. Note 3: For example, the Upfront Fee on a $5,000,000 loan with a 75% guaranty ($3.75 million guaranteed portion) would be 3.5% of $1,000,000 ($35,000) PLUS 3.75% of $2,750,000 ($103,125), which totals $138,125. For SBA Express only : The Upfront Fee is waived for loans to businesses owned and controlled by a veteran (other than a veteran who received a Dishonorable or Bad Conduct Discharge), Service-Disabled Veterans; Active Duty military service member participating in the military’s Transition Assistance Program (TAP); or spouse of a Veteran, Active Duty service member, or widowed spouse of a service member who died while in service or of a service-connected disability.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_42_915872985", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Upfront Fee Calculation for Multiple 7(a) Loans Within 90 Days. a) If more than one 7(a) loan (with maturities exceeding 12 months) is approved for an Applicant, including loans approved to its affiliates, within 90 days of each other, the loans are considered as one loan for the purpose of determining the percentage of guaranty and the Upfront Fee calculation. This rule applies regardless of whether the loans were approved by the same or different 7(a) Lenders. b) When two or more 7(a) loans are approved within 90 calendar days of each other, the applicable fee for the subsequent loans is equal to the Upfront Fee that would have been charged had all the loans been combined into one loan. The applicable fee for the subsequent loan(s) will equal the amount of the fee that would have been charged had the loans been combined, less the amount of the fee from the first loan approved. c) When the Applicant receives both a short and long term 7(a) loan, the percentage of guaranty is calculated as if the loans are combined, but the Upfront Fee is based solely on the maturity of each loan. d) If a short-term 7(a) loan that was made within 90 days of a long term 7(a) loan is renewed and the maturity is extended beyond 12 months, the Upfront Fee calculated at the time of renewal would equal the fee that would have been charged if both 7(a) loans were originally long term. The amount owed SBA at the time of renewal would equal the recalculated Upfront Fee less the amount paid at the time of original approval. e) This rule also applies to any subsequent increases to either of the 7(a) loans made within the 90 day period, even if one of the loans subsequently is paid in full. iii. When the Upfront Fee Must be Paid (13 CFR § 120.220(b) ): The 7(a) Lender must pay the Upfront Fee to SBA as follows: a) Short-term loans (maturities of 12 months or less): i) The 7(a) Lender must pay the Upfront Fee through www.pay.gov within 10 business days from the date the SBA Loan Number is assigned. If the fee is not received within 10 business days after issuance of the SBA Loan Number, SBA will cancel the guaranty. ii) For EWCP loans re-issued after 12 months, each time the loan is re- issued it is a new loan, and another Upfront Fee is due. SBA earns the short-term Upfront Fee when the SBA loan number is issued. iii) The 7(a) Lender may only charge the Upfront Fee to the Borrower after the 7(a) Lender has paid the Upfront Fee. b) Loans with maturities in excess of 12 months:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_43_42498485", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the Upfront Fee is not paid within 90 days, the guaranty will be cancelled. The 7(a) Lender may charge the Upfront Fee to the Borrower after initial disbursement; however, the first disbursement may not be made solely or primarily for the purpose of paying the Upfront Fee. ii) Notification of Fee Due: When SBA issues an SBA loan number, this is the Lender’s notification that an Upfront Fee is due and payable within 90 days. SBA may, but is not required to, inform the 7(a) Lender when the Upfront Fee has not been received by SBA within the required time frame. Neither the issuance by SBA of any notice of non-payment nor the receipt of any notice of non-payment by the 7(a) Lender waives the 7(a) Lender’s obligation to pay the fee within 90 days of approval. In addition, the obligation to pay the Upfront Fee to SBA is not contingent upon the Borrower having paid the fee to the 7(a) Lender. c) THE DUE DATE FOR UPFRONT FEE PAYMENT MAY NOT BE WAIVED OR EXTENDED EVEN IF THE DISBURSEMENT PERIOD IS EXTENDED. iv. Additional Upfront Fee for Loan Increases. a) When a 7(a) loan is increased, additional appropriations are committed, and an additional Upfront Fee is due. The additional fee is based on the rules in effect at the time the loan was originally approved. Therefore, the amount of the additional Upfront Fee due for an increase will equal what the Upfront Fee would have been if the increase was part of the original loan amount, less the amount of the Upfront Fee (if already remitted). b) The additional Upfront Fee associated with the increase must be paid electronically within 30 days from the date the increase was approved, or the total loan guaranty will be cancelled. c) On loans that have been initially disbursed, the Upfront Fee associated with any increase approved by SBA must be paid to SBA, whether or not the increase is subsequently cancelled. v. Additional Upfront Fee for Extensions of Short-Term Loans. a) When the maturity of a short-term 7(a) loan is extended beyond 12 months, an additional Upfront Fee is due. The 7(a) Lender may contact the appropriate SBA CLSC for assistance. The additional fee must be paid electronically within 30 days from the date the 7(a) Lender agrees to the extension or the total loan guaranty will be cancelled. The 7(a) Lender may charge the additional fee to the Borrower after the 7(a) Lender has notified SBA that the maturity has been extended and has paid the additional Upfront Fee. b) No additional Upfront Fees will be owed for loans extended beyond their original maturity date when SBA determines the extension is to effect", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_44_155310613", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Method of Upfront Fee Payment. The 7(a) Lender must electronically pay the Upfront Fee either by using their existing SBA-approved bulk ACH method or through www.pay.gov. When using www.pay.gov, select “form type 1544” and select “guaranty.” The loan must have been approved and an SBA Loan Number issued in order to use www.pay.gov. Any questions regarding this requirement can be emailed to payment.services@sba.gov. vii. Reinstatement of Guaranty After Cancellation. If SBA cancelled its guaranty because the 7(a) Lender did not pay the Upfront Fee, the 7(a) Lender may request that SBA consider reinstating its guaranty. The 7(a) Lender must submit a written request to either the LGPC or the appropriate SBA CLSC in accordance with Section B, Ch 5, “ E-Tran Terms and Conditions through Disbursement for all 7(a)Loans”. If SBA reinstates the guaranty, the required Upfront Fee must be electronically paid within 30 days from the date of reinstatement or the guaranty will be cancelled. The request must include the following: a) SBA Loan Number and the SBA Loan Name; b) A certification that there has been no unremedied adverse change in the financial condition, organization, operations, or fixed assets of the Borrower or Operating Company since the date of application for guaranty; c) If the loan has been disbursed in whole or in part, a certification that the loan is current, the 7(a) Lender has been reporting the loan on all SBA Form 1502 monthly reports sinc e the loan was disbursed, and the 7(a) Lender has been paying the Lender’s Annual Service Fee in a timely manner on this loan; and d) A complete written explanation as to why the 7(a) Lender failed to pay the Upfront Fee and what the 7(a) Lender has done to correct any deficiencies in its procedures. viii. Upfront Fee Refunds (13 CFR §120.220(c)). The Upfront Fee is based on the amount that SBA has approved prior to the loan being closed and initially disbursed. Any request by the 7(a) Lender to decrease the approved amount must be approved by SBA prior to the date the loan is closed and initially disbursed by the 7(a) Lender in order for the Upfront Fee to be reduced. The 7(a) Lender must submit a request to the appropriate SBA CLSC via E-Tran for an adjustment to the approved amount of the loan and Upfront Fee. a) Full refund: The Upfront Fee may be refunded only for a loan with a maturity of more than 12 months and when the loan has not been closed and initially disbursed and the 7(a) Lender submits a written request to", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_45_729999974", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Once a loan has been initially disbursed, no refund is permitted. b) Partial refund: If SBA approves the cancellation of a portion of the loan prior to the loan being closed and initially disbursed, SBA will adjust the Upfront Fee payable to reflect the new loan amount and refund the excess amount if the fee has already been paid. If the loan has been closed and initially disbursed, no refund is permitted. 7(a) Lender’s Annual Service Fee (Lender’s Annual Service Fee) (13 CFR § 120.220(f)). The 7(a) Lender must pay SBA a Lender’s Annual Service Fee. The fee is based on the outstanding principal balance of the guaranteed portion of the loan at the time of SBA Loan approval. SBA specifies the amount of the fee each fiscal year for all loans approved during that year through an Information Notice. This fee cannot be charged to the Borrower. When multiple 7(a) loans are made within 90 days of each other, the Lender’s Annual Service Fee is set for each loan on a standalone basis without respect to any other loans made (i.e., the loans are not aggregated). The 7(a) Lender pays this fee on a monthly basis with submission of SBA Form 1502, “Guaranty Loan Status and Remittance Form.” SBA may charge the 7(a) Lender a late fee if the on-going guaranty fee is not paid timely. For EWCP payment options, see Section B, Ch. 4, Para. B.5.e., Payment Options for EWCP Ongoing Guaranty Fee. Note: The fee will be listed in the E-Tran terms and conditions and it is the 7(a) Lender's responsibility to ensure that the E-Tran terms and conditions includes the correct fee. 2. Fees and Expenses the Lender May Collect from the Applicant or Borrower In 13 CFR § 120.221, SBA provides specific guidance on the fees a 7(a) Lender or its Associates may collect from an Applicant or Borrower in connection with an SBA-guaranteed loan. Service and Packaging Fees 13 CFR § 120.221(a) i. The Lender may charge an applicant reasonable fees (customary for similar Lenders in the geographic area where the loan is being made) for packaging and other services. Note: The Applicant may not be charged for the same service by two different entities. ii. The Lender must advise the Applicant in writing that the Applicant is not required to obtain or pay for unwanted services. The Lender must itemize for the Applicant in writing any fees charged in association with the 7(a) loan. Itemization means listing the category of fees identified under 13 CFR § 120.221. The Applicant is responsible for deciding whether fees are reasonable. SBA may review these fees at any time. Lender must refund any such fee considered unreasonable by SBA.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_46_87220183", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

As part of its service and packaging fee, Lenders may charge fees associated with technology services (whether developed internally or purchased from a third party) on a pro rata basis for software or technology used in connection with preparing SBA loan documents, underwriting, or closing the SBA- guaranteed loan. Note: Entities providing technology services that include underwriting are considered to be LSPs and must be providing their services to the Lender under an SBA-reviewed LSP Agreement. iv. SBA permits the Lender to charge the Applicant a flat fee of up to $2,500 per loan. The Lender must disclose any amounts charged to the Applicant by the Lender in E-Tran. v. For fee amounts in excess of $2,500, the Lender must complete an SBA Form 159 in accordance with Paragraph D.8., Disclosure of Fees – SBA Form 159 , in this Chapter. a) For fees charged on an hourly rate, the fees must be reasonable and customary for the services actually performed and consistent with fees charged on an hourly rate for the Lender’s similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. b) For fees charged based on a percentage of the loan amount, the fee may not exceed what the Lender charges on a percentage basis for the Lender’s similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans or the following, whichever is less: i) 5% for loans $150,000 or less; ii) 3% for loans in excess of $150,000; iii) the maximum fee that may be charged to an Applicant on a percentage basis is $30,000. vi. The Lender may not split a loan into two loans for the purpose of charging an additional fee to the Applicant. Even if there is a legitimate business need for the Applicant’s loan request to be split into two loans (e.g., a term loan and a line of credit), the Lender may only charge the Applicant one fee within the maximums set forth above, based on the combined loan amounts. However, it is not SBA’s intention to restrict a Lender from charging a new fee if an Applicant subsequently returns to the Lender to apply for a new loan for a different project or purpose. (Loans approved more than 90 days apart are considered to be for a different project or purpose.) Extraordinary Servicing Fee. 13 CFR § 120.221(b) i. A Lender may not charge the Borrower a servicing fee on an SBA-guaranteed loan unless the servicing fee is to cover expenses for extraordinary servicing requirements connected with the loan. Such a fee may not exceed 2% per year on the outstanding balance of the part of the loan requiring special servicing. Examples of extraordinary servicing fees include amounts to service construction loans or monitor accounts receivable and inventory collateral in asset-based lending. In addition, if the Lender charges an extraordinary", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_47_172289150", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the Lender does not charge an extraordinary servicing fee on its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, it may not charge an extraordinary servicing fee on its SBA-guaranteed loans. ii. A Lender may charge extraordinary servicing fees in excess of 2% for EWCP or Working Capital CAPLine loans that are disbursed based on a Borrowing Based Certificate. The fees charged must be reasonable and prudent based on the level of extraordinary effort required and must not be higher than the fees charged on the Lender’s similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. iii. Lenders must obtain SBA’s prior written approval for the fees in subparagraph b.i. and b.ii. above and must include the extraordinary servicing fees to be charged to administer the loan/line in its credit memorandum. Lenders submitting applications under delegated authority must enter the amount of the fee to be charged in E-Tran and certify in the credit memorandum that the fee is reasonable and prudent based on the level of extraordinary effort required. SBA’s issuance of a loan number will constitute its prior written approval of the fees, subject to SBA’s subsequent review of the fees for reasonableness. SBA will review such fees when conducting Lender oversight activities and at time of guaranty purchase. If SBA determines the fee is excessive, the Lender must reduce the fee to an amount SBA deems reasonable, refund any sum in excess of that amount to the Borrower, and refrain from charging or collecting from the Borrower any funds in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable. SBA’s guaranty does not extend to extraordinary servicing fees and, at time of guaranty purchase, SBA will not pay any portion of such fees. iv. The following actions do not qualify as extraordinary servicing and therefore a participating Lender is prohibited from collecting fees for these services: a) Changing the installment amount to avoid circumstances where the required payment amount will not be sufficient to pay the loan in full by the maturity date; b) Changing the installment amount after a deferment; c) Providing the release or exchange of collateral (standard out-of-pocket expenses such as recordation fees are permitted); or d) Any modification to the repayment terms of the note. v. Past due financial statements: SBA permits a Lender to charge a separate servicing fee for past due financial statements. The past due financial statements extraordinary servicing fee must be consistent with those fees charged by the Lender for similarly sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. The SBA recognizes the desire for the American taxpayer to ensure that measures necessary to mitigate loan default and loan loss are necessary and therefore, believes that the Lender needs the ability to enforce ongoing", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_48_121697661", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The discretion to charge a separate extraordinary servicing fee for past due financial statements is based upon the Lenders policy on similarly sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans as documented by the Lender policy. Failure to charge a fee or exercising the discretion to charge a fee will not be evaluated when the Lender submits a purchase request because this is intended to enable Lender policy and Lender discretion to positively influence the Applicant behavior towards their reporting obligations which mitigates taxpayer loan loss. Out-of-Pocket Expenses. 13 CFR § 120.221(c) i. The Lender may collect from the Applicant necessary out-of-pocket expenses such as filing or recording fees, photocopying, delivery charges, collateral appraisals and environmental investigation reports that are obtained in compliance with SBA policy, and other direct charges related to loan closing. These costs must be itemized and kept in the loan file for SBA’s review. ii. Lenders may be reimbursed by the Applicant for the direct costs (including reasonable overhead) of legal services performed by the Lender’s in-house counsel in connection with an SBA-guaranteed loan, but in no event may the Lender be reimbursed for an amount that would exceed the cost of outside counsel. iii. In accordance with 13 CFR § 120.221(e) , charges for legal services (regardless of who provides the service) must be charged on an hourly basis. The Lender or its Associate may not pass on to the Applicant/Borrower any cost of legal services not calculated on an hourly basis for services provided in connection with the Applicant/Borrower’s transaction. iv. Direct costs associated with out-of-pocket expenses described in this section in connection with the loan closing should not be reported on SBA Form 159, but must be available for SBA review when conducting lender oversight activities. Late Payment Fee. 13 CFR § 120.221(d) Lenders may charge the Borrower a late payment fee not to exceed 5% of the regular loan payment when the Borrower is more than 10 days delinquent on its regularly scheduled payment. The fee is the property of the Lender and is not shared with the investor if the loan is sold into the Secondary Market. SBA’s guaranty does not extend to late fees and, at time of guaranty purchase, SBA will not pay any portion of such fees. Assumption Fee. Lenders should review SBA’s SOP 50 57, 7(a) Loan Servicing and Liquidation, for procedures to process an assumption request. i. In the case of an assumption of the loan by another entity, SBA does not require a new guaranty fee, and lien positions are often maintained eliminating the need for recording fees. As an incentive for a 7(a) Lender to retain an existing loan, SBA allows a 7(a) Lender to charge an assumption fee that is", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_49_610732477", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The fee must be reasonable in relation to services provided and cannot exceed 1 percent of the principal balance outstanding at time of assumption. SBA’s guaranty does not extend to assumption fees and, at time of guaranty purchase, SBA will not pay any portion of such fees. ii. This fee may be paid by the seller or the assumptor. 3. Fees the Borrower Pays to SBA Subsidy Recoupment Fee 13 CFR § 120.223 For loans with a maturity of 15 years or longer, the Borrower must pay to SBA a Subsidy Recoupment Fee when the Borrower voluntarily prepays more than 25% of its loan in any 1 year during the first 3 years after first disbursement. The fee is 5% of the prepayment amount during the first year, 3% the second year, and 1% in the third year. SBA does not consider death that results in a prepayment a voluntary occurrence. No determination by SBA is required in this circumstance, and the 7(a) Lender must confirm and document their file. If the 7(a) Lender otherwise believes that the prepayment of the loan is not voluntary, the 7(a) Lender may submit a request for a determination, with the 7(a) Lender’s supporting analysis, to the appropriate CLSC. The CLSC will submit the request, along with its recommendation to the Director of the Office of Financial Program Operations (D/OFPO) and the D/FA or designee for a joint determination as to whether a prepayment is involuntary. 4. Prohibited Fees Any fee not expressly permitted in 13 CFR § 120.221 is prohibited. For example, 7(a) Lenders and/or their Associates may not: Require the Applicant or Borrower to pay the 7(a) Lender, a 7(a) Lender’s Associate, or any party designated by either, any fees or charges for goods or services, including insurance, as a condition for obtaining an SBA-guaranteed loan; Charge the Borrower any commitment, bonus, origination, broker, commission, referral, or similar fees; Charge points or add-on interest; Charge prepayment fees; Charge renewal fees; or Share any portion of the premium received from the sale of an SBA-guaranteed loan in the Secondary Market with a Service Provider, Packager, or other non- employee loan referral source. D. 7(A) LOAN PROGRAM AND USE OF AGENTS SBA permits a third party to charge an Applicant fees for packaging and other services. Prior to any services being provided, the 7(a) Lender must advise the Applicant in writing that the Applicant is not required to obtain or pay for unwanted services.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_50_570161412", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Use of Agents in the 7(a) Loan Program SBA regulations at 13 CFR Part 103 govern the activities of Agents, the disclosure of fees, and the circumstances that would result in revocation or suspension of the Agent’s privilege to conduct business with SBA. i. SBA expects 7(a) Lenders to exercise due diligence and prudent oversight of their third party vendors, including LSPs, and other loan agents. ii. Prudent oversight should include having written policies governing such relationships and monitoring performance of loans referred by an Agent or where an Agent provided assistance. iii. SBA will review evidence of such due diligence and oversight of such relationships when conducting lender oversight activities. iv. Federally-regulated 7(a) Lenders are reminded that they must comply with the requirements of their primary Federal Financial Institution Regulator regarding third party vendors. The Director of SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management may, for good cause, suspend or revoke the privilege of an Agent to conduct business with the government. The suspension or revocation will remain in effect during any administrative proceedings under SBA regulations at 13 CFR Part 134. The meaning of “good cause” can be found at c. Agents and Privacy Act Considerations. Proprietary information is protected by the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Privacy Act. Private information about a loan cannot be discussed with anyone who claims to be an Agent for an Applicant or 7(a) Lender without evidence of representation. SBA may require that an Agent supply written evidence of their authority to act on behalf of an Applicant or 7(a) Lender as a condition of revealing any information about the Applicant’s or 7(a) Lender’s current or prior dealings with the SBA. Employment of Agent Initiated by Applicant. 7(a) Lenders and Agents must clearly inform any Applicant that the SBA does not require the use of an Agent for packaging or referring a loan application. When an Applicant employs an Agent: i. The Agent may bill and be paid by the Applicant for providing packaging services as long as compensation is reasonable and customary for those services; the compensation complies with SBA Loan Program Requirements; and the compensation is not contingent on the loan being approved or closed. ii. The Agent who works for an Applicant as a packager may also work as a Loan Referral Agent for the Applicant and receive a referral fee from the Applicant. However, if the Agent performs multiple services for the Applicant, the total fee for all services may not exceed the stated maximums in paragraph D.7. below.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_51_866165132", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Agent may be a Loan Referral Agent for a 7(a) Lender and a Packager for an Applicant, provided both the Applicant and the 7(a) Lender are aware of both relationships, and the Agent does not receive a referral fee from the Applicant or a packaging fee from the 7(a) Lender. Employment of Agent by 7(a) Lender (not an LSP). i. When a 7(a) Lender has decided to approve a loan application and needs assistance with the preparation of the paperwork for the application to SBA, the loan closing, or preparation of the loan to sell it on the Secondary Market, the 7(a) Lender may use an Agent. ii. The compensation for these services should be reasonable and customary for the services actually provided and compensation for services associated with preparation of the application through loan closing cannot be contingent upon the loan being approved or closed by SBA. iii. The Agent must bill and be paid by the 7(a) Lender for all services and the 7(a) Lender may not pass these charges through to the Applicant or pay them with SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds under any circumstances. 2. Agents 13 CFR § 103.1(a) SBA defines an “Agent” to mean an authorized representative, including an attorney, accountant, consultant, packager, lender service provider, or any other individual or entity representing an Applicant or participant by conducting business with SBA. For Lender Service Providers, SBA reviews the written agreement between the Lender and the Lender Service Provider, thus SBA Form 159 is not required for the services provided by the Lender Service Provider to the Lender. ( 13 CFR § 103.5(c)) F ees paid by the Lender to the Lender Service Provider cannot be passed onto the Applicant. For Agents not covered by an SBA-reviewed LSP Agreement, whether paid by the Applicant or the Lender, SBA Form 159 must be completed and signed by the Applicant and the Lender. For each Agent paid by the Applicant to assist it in connection with its application, the Agent also must complete and sign the form. When an Agent is paid by the Lender, the Lender must identify the Agent on SBA Form 159 and the Lender and Applicant must sign the form. The only situation where an Agent can receive compensation from both the Lender and the Applicant is when the Agent is providing different services by providing packaging services to the Applicant and receiving a referral fee from the Lender. ( 13 CFR § 103.4(g)) The SBA does not allow contingency fees (fees paid only if the loan is approved or closed) or charges for services which are not reasonably necessary in connection with an application.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_52_590282605", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Referral Agents 13 CFR § 103.1(f) “Referral Agent” means a person or entity that identifies and refers an Applicant to a Lender or a Lender to an Applicant. The referral agent may be employed and compensated by either an Applicant or a Lender, but not both. Each referral agent, including loan packagers, must disclose the name of its customer and all fees charged in connection with the SBA loan transaction on SBA Form 159. 4. Packager 13 CFR § 103.1(e) “Packager” means an Agent who is employed and compensated by an Applicant or Lender to prepare the Applicant’s application for financial assistance from SBA. The packager may be the Lender. For 7(a) loans, if a CDC employee performs packaging or loan referral services within the scope of their CDC employment, both the CDC and the employee are Agents. If a CDC employee acts as a Packager or Referral Agent outside the scope of their employment, the CDC is not considered an Agent. 5. Lender Service Provider 13 CFR § 103.1(d) “Lender Service Provider” means an Agent who carries out Lender functions in originating, disbursing, servicing, or liquidating a specific SBA business loan or loan portfolio for compensation from the Lender. A Lender must have a continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, service, liquidate and litigate small business loans ( 13 CFR § 120.410). A Lender may contract with a third party (Lender Service Provider (LSP)) to assist the Lender with one or more of these functions. However, the Lender itself, not the LSP, must be able to demonstrate that it exercises day-to-day responsibility for evaluating, processing, closing, disbursing, servicing, liquidating, and litigating its SBA portfolio. SBA determines whether or not an Agent is an LSP on a loan-by-loan basis. If an Agent meets the definition of an LSP, a formal agreement between the Agent and Lender is required and must be reviewed by SBA. All participating Lenders must submit each LSP agreement to the LGPC for review. Lenders may submit the agreements to LSPagreements@sba.gov. If there are any changes to an LSP agreement after review by SBA, the Lender must submit the revised agreement to SBA for review. SBA will investigate any complaint by an Applicant, Lender, or any other participant in an SBA program, concerning the activity, services completed, or fees charged by any LSP.

Lender Service Provider Agreements 13 CFR § 103.1(d) A 7(a) Lender may contract with a third party LSP to assist the 7(a) Lender with one or more lender functions. The LSP must perform these services under a written LSP Agreement between the 7(a) Lender and the LSP that must be submitted to SBA for review. A 7(a) Lender must have a continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, service, liquidate and litigate small business loans (13 CFR § 120.410). The 7(a) Lender itself, not the LSP, bears full responsibility for all aspects of its SBA Loan operation and must be able to demonstrate that it exercises day-to-day responsibility for evaluating, processing, closing, disbursing, servicing, liquidating, and litigating its SBA portfolio. An LSP may only receive compensation from the 7(a) Lender for services provided under an SBA-reviewed LSP Agreement. Such charges must not be passed on to the Applicant or paid out of the SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds. Services performed by the LSP for the 7(a) Lender in accordance with the LSP Agreement are not reported on SBA Form 159. (13 CFR § 103.5(c)). The following are examples of when SBA considers an Agent to meet the definition of an LSP: i. An individual or entity engaged by a 7(a) Lender to provide services for the purposes of obtaining Federal financial assistance that include interaction with the Applicant either in-person or through the use of technology, to request or obtain financial information that will be provided to the 7(a) Lender or SBA. This includes Agents who: a) Perform any pre-qualification review based on SBA’s Loan Program Requirements or the 7(a) Lender’s internal policies prior to submitting the Applicant’s information to the 7(a) Lender; or b) Provide to the 7(a) Lender an underwritten application, whether through the use of technology or otherwise. ii. Entities providing technology services to a 7(a) Lender that include underwriting. iii. An individual or entity generates a significant number of the 7(a) Lender’s loan originations. As a general rule, SBA considers a “significant number” to be two-thirds (66%) or more of the 7(a) Lender’s loan originations for the prior 12 months. SBA will investigate any complaint by an Applicant, 7(a) Lender or any other participant in an SBA program concerning the activity, services completed, or fees charged by any LSP. An LSP Agreement may not grant the LSP power of attorney to act on behalf of the 7(a) Lender.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_54_389509231", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The funds must be held in an account in the 7(a) Lender’s name, not the name of the LSP; however, consistent with the LSP Agreement, the LSP may be permitted limited access to the account in order to process Borrower payments; ii. For those loans where the guaranteed portion has been sold on the Secondary Market, the account also must be properly titled in accordance with SBA Form 1086, “Secondary Participation Guaranty Agreement.” iii. The LSP may not commingle any funds from multiple lenders; there must be separate accounts for each of its lender clients. iv. The LSP may not net its fee out of any Borrower payments or other funds collected on the 7(a) Lender’s behalf. All participating 7(a) Lenders must submit each LSP agreement to the LGPC for review at LSPagreements@sba.gov.

Term: The full term of the contract including renewal options must be stated in order for SBA to determine if it is reasonable. In addition, the contract must clearly identify terms and conditions satisfactory to SBA that permit either party to terminate the contract prior to its expiration date on a reasonable basis (usually 60 days or sooner for cause). vii.

Other services that include consulting as to the amount and type of financing needed and broker or referral fees. (As stated above, the 7(a) Lender and its Associates are prohibited from charging an Applicant for these services.) Regardless of who pays the Agent, the fees must be reasonable and customary for the services actually performed and, for those Lenders with non-SBA guaranteed portfolios, must be consistent with those fees charged on the 7(a) Lender’s similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. If the 7(a) Lender does not charge a particular fee on its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, it may not charge the fee on its SBA guaranteed loans.

SBA regulations at 13 CFR § 103.5 require the Applicant, 7(a) Lender, and any Agent to execute and provide to SBA a compensation agreement (“Agreement”). Each Agreement governs the compensation charged for services rendered or to be rendered to the Applicant or 7(a) Lender in any matter involving SBA assistance. 7(a) Lenders must identify in E-Tran whether the 7(a) Lender charged any fees and the amount of those fees, and whether an Agent was involved in any way with the transaction. When an Agent was involved in the transaction, the 7(a) Lender must provide the name, street address, city, state, and zip code of the Agent. Failure to do so may result in a finding by OCRM when conducting lender oversight activities. SBA Form 159 can be generated using E-Tran. For Agents other than LSPs performing duties under an SBA-reviewed LSP Agreement, if the Agent is paid by an Applicant or a 7(a) Lender, an SBA Form 159 must be completed in accordance with form instructions and signed by the Applicant, the Agent, and the 7(a) Lender.

If the CDC or SBA declines the application, the deposit will be refunded in full within 10 business days after decline, including any period for reconsideration; ii. If SBA approves the loan, the deposit may be applied toward the CDC processing fee described in 13 CFR § 120.883 ; and iii. If the Applicant withdraws its loan application at any time before SBA issues the E-Tran terms and conditions, the CDC may deduct its reasonable and necessary costs incurred in packaging and processing the loan application. Such costs must be documented and cannot be a percentage of the loan. Any remaining deposit balance must be remitted to the Applicant within 10 business days of the withdrawal. A copy of the agreement must be placed in the CDC’s file. 2.

Fees for Other Services The CDC may be compensated for other services such as packaging and servicing a 7(a) loan or providing assistance unrelated to the 504 loan program to a small business. Such fees are to be charged pursuant to a written agreement, between the CDC and the entity for which the CDC is providing services, setting forth the roles and relationships of the parties as well as terms and conditions and must be in compliance with SBA Loan Program Requirements. The CDC may not make such assistance a condition of the CDC accepting from a small business an application for a 504 loan.

Fees associated with technology services (whether developed internally or purchased from a third party) may not be passed on to the Borrower. Examples of technology services fees that may not be passed on to the Borrower include: i.

Note: SBA does not consider entities providing technology services that do not include underwriting to be Agents. Entities providing technology services that include underwriting are considered to be professional services contractors and must be providing their services to the CDC under an SBA- approved professional services contract. See Paragraph E.6.a, Professional Services Contractors, in this Chapter for more information. 4. Use of Agents in the 504 Loan Program SBA expects CDCs to exercise due diligence and prudent oversight of their third party vendors, including professional service contractors and other loan agents, which should include having written policies governing such relationships and monitoring performance of loans referred by an Agent or where an Agent provided assistance. SBA will review evidence of such due diligence and oversight of such relationships when conducting CDC oversight activities. SBA regulations at 13 CFR Part 103 govern the activities of Agents, the disclosure of fees, and the circumstances that would result in revocation or suspension of the Agent’s privilege to conduct business with SBA. In 13 CFR § 103.1(a), SBA defines an “Agent” to mean an authorized representative, including an attorney, accountant, consultant, packager, lender service provider, or any other person representing an Applicant or participant by conducting business with SBA. Note: The term Agent in 13 CFR 103.1(a) includes Lender Service Providers, which are used only in the 7(a) Loan Program. Professional Services Contractors are used in the 504 Loan Program and are described in Paragraph 5. Below For individuals or entities operating under a professional services contract with a CDC, SBA approves the written agreement or contract with the CDC and the SBA Form 159 is not required. (13 CFR §§ 103.5(c) and 120.824) (Professional Services Contracts are used under the 504 Program rather than Lender Service Provider Agreements. See paragraph 6.a. Professional Services Contractors, below, for guidance on professional service contracts.) Fees paid by the CDC in accordance with the professional services contract cannot be passed onto the Applicant. For all other Agents, paid by either an Applicant or a CDC, an SBA Form 159 must be completed and signed by the Applicant, the CDC, and the Agent. See paragraph 6. Disclosure of Fees – SBA Form 159, below, for more information on SBA Form 159. The only situation where an Agent can receive compensation from both the CDC and the Applicant is when the Agent is providing different services by providing packaging services to the Applicant and receiving a referral fee from the CDC. The SBA does not allow contingency fees (fees paid only if the loan is approved or closed) or charges for services which are not reasonably necessary in connection with an application.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_63_571147654", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The suspension or revocation will remain in effect during any administrative proceedings under SBA regulations at 13 CFR Part 134. The meaning of “good cause” can be found at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title- 13/chapter-I/part-103#103.4. Agents and Privacy Act Considerations: Private information about a loan cannot be discussed with anyone who claims to be an Agent for an Applicant or CDC without evidence of representation. Proprietary information is protected by the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Privacy Act. Without proper authorization, SBA and CDCs may not discuss private information with even a spouse or other close relative of the Applicant. SBA may require that an Agent supply written evidence of their authority to act on behalf of an applicant or CDC as a condition of revealing any information about the applicant’s or CDC’s current or prior dealings with the SBA. 5. Fees an Agent May Charge an Applicant for Packaging and Other Services CDCs and Agents must clearly inform any Applicant in writing that the SBA does not require the use of an Agent for packaging or referring a loan application. An Agent may charge an Applicant for: i. Packaging services to assist the Applicant with completing one or more applications, preparing a business plan, cash flow projections, and other documents related to the application; and ii. Other services that include consulting as to the amount and type of financing needed and broker or referral fees. The fees must be reasonable and customary for the services actually performed. An Agent may charge an Applicant fees for packaging and other services based on an hourly rate or on a percentage of the loan amount. In either case, all fees over $2,500 must be supported by documenting the service performed. For fees charged to an Applicant on an hourly rate, there is no maximum, but the fees must be reasonable and customary for the services actually performed. The hourly rate and time spent on each service must be documented. For fees charged to an Applicant based on a percentage of the loan amount, the fee may not exceed (if multiple services are provided to the Applicant, the combined fee for all services cannot exceed the stated maximums below): i. 3 percent on loans of $50,000 or less; ii. 2 percent for loans between $50,000 and the first $1,000,000 and 0.25 percent on the portion over $1,000,000; however, iii.

SBA does not allow an Agent to charge an Applicant: i. A standard or flat fee charged to all Applicants; ii. Contingency fees (fees paid only if the loan is approved or closed); or iii. For services that are not reasonably necessary in connection with an application. SBA may review these fees at any time. Agents must refund any fee considered unreasonable or impermissible by SBA. Review of Agent Fees: i. CDCs must review the Agent’s services and related fees to determine if the fees are necessary and reasonable when: a) There is an indication from a third party that an Agent’s fees might be excessive; or b) When an Applicant complains about the fees charged by an Agent. ii. In cases where fees appear to be unreasonable, CDCs should contact the D/OCRM to report the fees. iii. If an SBA investigation determines an Agent fee is excessive, the Agent must reduce the fee to an amount SBA deems reasonable, refund any sum in excess of that amount to the Applicant, and refrain from charging or collecting from the Applicant any funds in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable. 6. Professional Services Contractors 13 CFR § 120.824 Pre-approval of a professional services contract by the D/FA is required prior to engaging the services of a contractor for any of the following functions: • Managing (a request for a waiver of the requirement that the manager be employed directly by the CDC must be submitted to SBA; • Marketing; • Packaging; • Processing; • Closing; • Servicing; • Liquidating; • Legal services in connection with loan liquidation or litigation; • Independent Loan Reviews to be conducted by another CDC.

CDCs may contract for the following functions without SBA approval: • Accounting; • Legal services (except in connection with loan liquidation or litigation); • Information technology; and • Independent loan review services performed by a non-CDC. CDCs entering into a contract to provide services to another CDC: i. Must be located in the same SBA Region (except for contracts for liquidation services or independent loan reviews); or ii. If not located in the same SBA Region, must be located in a contiguous State (except for contracts for liquidation services or independent loan reviews); and iii. May provide assistance to only one CDC per State (except for contracts for liquidation services or independent loan reviews); iv. Must not provide assistance to another CDC in its State of Incorporation or any State in which the CDC has multi-state authority (except for contracts for liquidation services or independent loan reviews); v. Must have a separate and independent Board of Directors; vi. If either CDC is for-profit, neither may own stock in the other CDC; vii. CDCs are prohibited from comingling any funds. viii. Notwithstanding the prohibition in 13 CFR § 120.820(d) against a CDC affiliating with another CDC, a CDC may, with SBA’s prior written approval, obtain services through a contract with another CDC even if the arrangement would give rise to an affiliation between the CDCs based on an “identity of interest,” as defined under 13 CFR §121.103(f). However, affiliation between CDCs based on grounds other than identify of interest, including but not limited to, through ownership or common management under §121.103(c) and (e), respectively, would continue to be prohibited. Review and Pre-Approval: i. For all contracts that require prior approval (except for contracts involving legal services in connection with loan liquidation or litigation), the 504 Loan Program Division reviews the contracts and provides its recommendation to the D/FA, or designee, who makes the final decision. ii. With respect to contracts for management or independent loan reviews performed by another CDC, the D/FA’s final decision will be made in consultation with the D/OCRM (or designee).", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_66_901621781", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

SBA regulations at 13 CFR § 103.5 require the Applicant, CDC, and any Agent to execute and provide to SBA a compensation agreement (“Agreement”). Each Agreement governs the compensation charged for services rendered or to be rendered to the Applicant or CDC in any matter involving SBA assistance. CDCs must identify in E-Tran whether an Agent was involved in any way with the transaction and provide the name, street address, city, state, and zip code of the Agent. For Applications involving an Agent, SBA Form 159 can be generated using E-Tran. For Agents other than professional services contractors performing duties for the CDC under an SBA-approved professional services contract, if the Agent is paid by an Applicant or CDC, an BA Form 159 must be completed in accordance with form instructions and signed by the Applicant, the Agent, and the CDC. Do not report fees paid for the Third Party Lender’s loan on SBA Form 159. Separate SBA Forms 159 must be completed for each Agent who provides services to the Applicant. Failure of an Agent to fully complete and execute the required SBA Form 159 may result in suspension or revocation of the Agent’s privilege to conduct business with SBA under 13 CFR Part 103.

GUARANTIES 13 CFR § 120.160(a) Each loan must be guaranteed by at least one individual or entity. If no one individual or entity owns 20% or more of the Applicant, at least one of the owners must provide a full unconditional guaranty. In addition, if the guaranty will be provided by a trust, the requirements of paragraph 3, Corporate/Other Guaranties below must be met. 1. Personal Guaranties: Individuals who own 20% or more of an Applicant must provide an unlimited full guaranty. ( SBA Form 148 or, for 7(a) loans, equivalent Lender’s form). If a person has executed the Note as a Borrower in an individual capacity, that person does not also have to execute a personal guaranty. When ownership interest of an Applicant is held by a corporation, partnership or other form of legal entity, the ownership interests of all individuals must be disclosed. When deemed necessary for credit or other reasons, SBA or, for a loan processed on a delegated basis, the SBA Lender, may require other appropriate individuals or entities to provide full or limited guaranties of the loan without regard to the percentage of their ownership interests, if any. For example, an individual with a minority ownership or no ownership interest in the Applicant or OC who is critical to the operation of the business may be required to provide a personal guaranty (e.g., Supplemental Guarantors). If a limited guaranty is used, the SBA Lender must choose one of the payment limitation options in SBA Form 148L (Unconditional Limited Guaranty) or, for 7(a) loans, equivalent Lender’s form and specify the option in the E-Tran terms and conditions. The SBA Lender must obtain a personal financial statement from all individuals guaranteeing the loan except for: i. When the SBA Lender credit scores owners/guarantors for 7(a) loans $500,000 or less or for 504 projects $500,000 or less. ii. Supplemental Guarantors. 2. Guaranty of Spouse: Each spouse owning less than 20% of an Applicant must personally guarantee the loan in full when the combined ownership interest of both spouses and minor children is 20% or more. For a non-owner spouse, the SBA Lender must require the signature of the spouse on the appropriate collateral documents. The spouse’s guaranty secured by jointly held collateral will be limited to the spouse’s interest in the collateral.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_71_399312538", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Corporate/Other Guaranties: All entities that own 20% or more of an Applicant must provide an unlimited full guaranty. If the entity that owns 20% or more of the Applicant is a trust (revocable or irrevocable), the trust must guarantee the loan with the trustee executing the guaranty on behalf of the trust and providing the certifications required in Section A, Ch 2, paragraph B.1.b., Conditions that apply when the EPC is owned in whole or in part by a trust . In addition, if the trust is revocable, the Trustor also must guarantee the loan. 4. Substitution of Personal and/or Corporate Guaranty Liability The purpose of the use of guaranties for SBA loans is to mitigate against the risk of loss to taxpayers. To ensure this objective can be achieved across different types of SBA loans and financial transactions, SBA allows third-party individuals or entities to assume the liability of a personal or corporate guaranty, as applicable, for the guaranty of the individuals and/or entities that would otherwise be required to make a personal or corporate guaranty for an SBA loan. If the personal or corporate guaranty liability is assumed by a separate entity or individual, the substitute guarantor must have a similar or greater value, and the personal/corporate guaranty liability agreement or transfer agreement must be submitted to the SBA Lender as part of the complete loan package. If a substitute guarantor will be used, SBA Lender must identify in the E-Tran terms and conditions both the substituted guarantor and the individual or corporate entity being substituted, and if applicable, the personal/corporate guaranty liability agreement or transfer agreement must be submitted to the SBA Lender as part of the complete loan package. B. IRS TAX TRANSCRIPT/VERIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION 1. The purpose of SBA’s Tax Verification process is to determine if: The Applicant filed business tax returns; and The Applicant’s financial statements provided as part of the application agree with the business tax returns submitted to the IRS. 2. If an Applicant has not filed required Federal tax returns, the Applicant is not eligible for SBA financial assistance. 3. For a sole proprietorship, the SBA Lender must verify the Schedule C. 4. For a change of ownership, the SBA Lender must verify the seller’s business tax returns or a sole proprietor’s Schedule C. For 7(a) loans, when there is an acquisition of a division or a segment of an existing business, other forms of verification acceptable to SBA may be used in lieu of the IRS Form 4506-C or IRS Form 8821 (e.g. Sales tax payment records). 5. For 7(a) loans $500,000 or less, the Lender must follow the same processes and procedures that it uses to verify financial information for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, but prior to first disbursement of loan proceeds, the Lender must obtain tax transcripts or business tax returns to verify the Applicant size. 6. For 7(a) loans greater than $500,000 and for all 504 loans, SBA Lenders must obtain tax return transcripts and reconcile the Applicant’s financial data against the tax transcripts,", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_72_89983388", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

If the Applicant has filed an extension for the most recent fiscal year, the SBA Lender must obtain a copy of the extension along with evidence of payment of estimated taxes. SBA Lenders may obtain tax transcripts through either of the following methods: i. Through the IRS’s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) program: SBA Lenders may either enroll in IVES or contract with an IVES participant. Additional information on IVES enrollment is available at www.irs.gov/individuals/ives-enrollment-procedures . Or; ii. By fully completing and submitting IRS Form 8821: a) SBA Lenders must ensure the type of transcript requested contains any changes to the original return. b) The SBA Lender must be listed as designee on line 2 of IRS Form 8821. If the SBA Lender uses an LSP for the application, both the SBA Lender and the LSP must be listed as designees on line 2 of IRS Form 8821. c) SBA will not permit the borrower or its own tax preparer or enrolled agent to file IRS Form 8821 for an SBA loan.

This exception applies any place in this SOP that references tax transcripts. C. INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS SBA Lenders must ensure all appropriate insurance requirements are included in the SBA-issued E-Tran terms and conditions and SBA Lender’s credit memorandum. 1. Hazard Insurance 13 CFR § 120.160(c) For 504 loans of all sizes, SBA requires hazard insurance on what is being acquired, refinanced, or improved by the 504 loan. For 7(a) loans greater than $500,000 and for 504 projects greater than $500,000: i. SBA requires hazard insurance on all assets pledged as collateral. The Borrower must also maintain a separate policy if the business is located in a state that requires additional coverage such as wind, hail, earthquake, or other. ii. Real Estate a) Coverage must be in the amount of the full replacement cost. b) If full replacement cost insurance is not available, coverage must be for the maximum insurable value. c) Insurance coverage must contain a MORTGAGEE CLAUSE (or substantial equivalent) in favor of the 7(a) Lender (for 7(a)), or the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_74_564042279", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The policy or endorsements must provide for at least 10 days prior written notice of policy cancellation to the 7(a) Lender (for 7(a)), or the CDC/SBA (for 504). 3. Flood Insurance SBA flood insurance requirements are based on the Standard Flood Hazard Determination ( FEMA Form 086-0-32 or its successor). The mandatory purchase of flood insurance will be required as set forth by the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance at 12 CFR 22, 12 CFR 208, 12 CFR 339, 12 CFR 614 and 12 CFR 760. Policies for condominium and cooperative units will consist of a policy obtained by the individual unit owner for the particular unit. For 504, CDCs must obtain a FEMA Form 086-0-32 (or its successor) or a copy of the form obtained by the Interim or Third Party Lender. Private flood insurance will be accepted; however, it must meet the same requirements as the standard NFIP policy. If used, private flood insurance must: i. Provide coverage that is at least as broad as the coverage provided under the standard NFIP policy, including when considering deductibles, exclusions, and conditions offered by the insurer; ii. Include an endorsement that the insurer must give 45 days’ notice of cancellation for non-renewal to the insured and the 7(a) Lender (for 7(a)), or the CDC/SBA (for 504); iii. Include information about the availability of flood insurance coverage under the NFIP; iv. Contain a mortgage interest clause similar to the one in the standard NFIP policy; v. Contain a provision requiring an insured to file suit not later than 1 year after date of a written denial of all or part of a claim under the policy; and vi. Contain cancellation provisions that are as restrictive as the provisions contained in the standard NFIP policy. If an SBA Lender is taking the business real estate as collateral, and if the loan proceeds are being used to refinance, acquire, install, improve, construct, or renovate real estate and/or machinery and equipment, the loan recipient must obtain flood insurance on the collateral and its contents if it is located in a special flood hazard area. SBA Lenders must notify Borrowers that flood insurance must be maintained under the NFIP or comparable private flood insurance (see subparagraph b above).", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_76_943582182", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

(“Maximum limit of coverage available” is the lesser of the maximum limit available under the NFIP for the type of structure or the insurable value of the structure.) Insurance coverage must contain a MORTGAGEE CLAUSE/LENDER’S LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE (or substantial equivalent) in favor of the 7(a) Lender (for 7(a)), or the CDC/SBA (for 504). This clause must provide that any action or failure to act by the debtor or owner of the insured property will not invalidate the interest of the 7(a) Lender (for 7(a)), or the CDC/SBA (for 504).

Life Insurance The following guidance on life insurance applies to all 7(a) and 504 loans: 7(a) Loans For all 7(a) loans, Lenders must follow their internal policy for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. When required, the Lender must obtain a collateral assignment identifying the Lender as assignee that is acknowledged by the Home Office of the Insurer. 504 Loans CDCs must assess whether the viability of the business is tied to an individual or individuals. Life insurance is required for the principals of sole proprietorships, single member LLCs, or for businesses otherwise dependent on one owner’s active participation when the SBA Loan is not fully collateralized. i. If the CDC determines the principal is uninsurable, the CDC must obtain written documentation from a licensed insurer of the same. ii. For each policy required under this paragraph, CDCs must obtain a collateral assignment identifying the CDC/SBA as assignee that is acknowledged by the Home Office of the Insurer. CDCs must ensure that the Applicant/Borrower pays the premiums on the policy (13 CFR § 120.970(c) ). iii. CDC may accept the pledge of an existing life insurance policy. Credit life insurance or whole life insurance should not be required.. iv. When required, the minimum term of life insurance is: a) 10 years for a 10 year debenture. b) 20 years for a 20 or 25 year debenture. v. For the purpose of life insurance calculation, the loan is considered fully collateralized when the value of the discounted collateral is equal to or greater than the net debenture amount. When the loan is not fully collateralized, the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_77_479140765", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

For life insurance only, the calculation of discounted collateral is as follows: a) Improved real estate at 85% of fair market value determined in accordance with the appraisal requirements in Section C, Chapter 1, paragraph E.2.b., Appraisals . b) New machinery and equipment (excluding furniture and fixtures) at 75% of price minus any prior liens. c) Used or existing machinery and equipment (excluding furniture and fixtures) at a maximum of 50% of Net Book Value or 80% with an Orderly Liquidation Appraisal minus any prior liens. D. HISTORIC PROPERTIES Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires Federal agencies to consider whether their federally-funded projects directly or indirectly adversely impact properties and sites that are listed or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). (54 U.S.C. § 300101 et seq.; 36 CFR §§ 60.1 et seq. and 800.1 et seq.) An SBA Loan is considered to directly or indirectly impact such a property or site if the SBA Loan transaction involves the purchase or renovation of a property or site (including installation of equipment). As set forth below, SBA will conduct a Section 106 review to determine whether the impact is adverse. For all SBA Loan transactions involving the purchase or renovation of a property or site, all SBA Lenders must conduct due diligence to determine whether the SBA Loan transaction involves a property or site that is listed on the NRHP or has historic significance such that it may be eligible to be listed on the NRHP (either individually or as part of a historic district). The due diligence conducted must follow prudent lending practices and be documented in the SBA Loan file. 1. If the SBA Lender’s due diligence does not yield information indicating that the property or site is listed on the NRHP or has historic significance such that it may be eligible to be listed on the NRHP (either individually or as part of a historic district), the SBA Lender must document its file and does not need to request a Section 106 review by local SBA counsel. However, the SBA Lender may request a Section 106 review by local SBA counsel if it subsequently receives a screen out notice from the SBA loan processing center. 2. If the SBA Lender’s due diligence yields information indicating that the property or site is listed on the NRHP or has historic significance such that it may be eligible to be listed on the NRHP (either individually or as part of a historic district), the SBA Lender must take the following actions: For SBA Loan transactions involving property or site acquisition where the Borrower, Co-Borrower, and/or Operating Company has no intention of altering, renovating, rehabilitating, restoring, and/or demolishing any part of the property or site:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_78_431988110", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Prior to submitting the SBA Loan application to the SBA loan processing center (non-delegated) or requesting an SBA Loan Number when processing the SBA Loan under delegated authority, the SBA Lender must obtain a Historic Property Borrower Certification executed by the Borrower, Co- Borrower, and/or Operating Company. This is a self-certification that no modifications will be made to the property or site during the term of the SBA Loan. This self-certification must be made on SBA Form 2481 , Historic Property Borrower Certification. ii. The SBA Lender must provide a copy of the executed SBA Form 2481 to local SBA counsel for review and clearance. This clearance will become null and void and a Section 106 review will be required if, between the date the SBA Form 2481 is executed and the date the SBA Loan is disbursed, the Borrower, Co-Borrower, and/or Operating Company changes its intentions or it is determined the property or site requires any alteration, addition, renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and/or demolition. iii. SBA Lenders processing the loan under their delegated authority must retain the executed SBA Form 2481 and clearance from local SBA counsel in the SBA Loan file. The executed SBA Form 2481 and clearance from local SBA counsel must be provided with any guaranty purchase request and may be reviewed by SBA when conducting lender oversight activities. iv. SBA Lenders processing the loan under non-delegated procedures must include the executed SBA Form 2481 and clearance from local SBA counsel with the application for review by the SBA loan processing center. For SBA Loan transactions where the Borrower, Co-Borrower, and/or Operating Company intends to alter, renovate, rehabilitate, restore, and/or demolish any part of the property or site (regardless of the source of the funds to finance these modifications), the SBA Lender must request a Section 106 review by local SBA counsel. i. In its request for a Section 106 review to local SBA counsel, the SBA Lender must provide: a) The names of the Borrower, Co-Borrower, and/or Operating Company; b) The SBA Loan Name; c) The results of its due diligence; d) A full and complete description of the planned modifications; and e) A statement regarding whether any of the planned modifications have commenced. If so, SBA Lender must instruct the Borrower, Co- Borrower, and/or Operating Company to stop work, otherwise the SBA Loan may not be approved and/or disbursed. f) If the Borrower, Co-Borrower, and/or Operating Company is under contract for the purchase of the property or site and the seller will not agree to extend the closing deadline to accommodate the Section 106 review process or other extenuating circumstances exist that would cause", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_79_251585618", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Depending upon the circumstances, SBA may exercise its discretion to issue the E-Tran terms and conditions with a Section 106 review condition consisting of the following or similar language: “Historic Property / Section 106 Review: Pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulations, prior to the SBA Loan closing and the commencement of any renovations, modifications, or repairs to the Property, Borrower, Co- Borrower, and Operating Company (if applicable) must obtain a historic property review clearance from SBA.” ii. Local SBA counsel will review the request and may request additional information from the SBA Lender to facilitate the review. a) If local SBA counsel determines during the review that the property or site is not listed on the NRHP and is not eligible to be listed on the NRHP because the property or site does not have any historic significance, local SBA counsel will provide a response to the SBA Lender indicating that a Section 106 review is not required. The response must be retained in the SBA Loan file and may be requested by the SBA loan processing center during application processing. b) If local SBA counsel determines during the review that the property or site is listed on the NRHP or may be eligible to be listed on the NRHP because the property or site has historic significance, and the modifications to the property or site have already commenced, local SBA counsel must perform a Section 110(k) review before proceeding with a Section 106 review under 54 U.S.C. § 306113 and 36 C.F.R. § 800.9(c) . If the modifications to the property or site have not yet commenced, local SBA counsel is not required to perform a section 110(k) review and instead will proceed directly to the Section 106 review. c) If local SBA counsel determines during the review that the property or site is listed on the NRHP or may be eligible to be listed on the NRHP because the property or site has historic significance, local SBA counsel will perform a Section 106 review following the procedures set forth in 36 CFR § 800.4 et seq. i) Among other things, the Section 106 review will involve evaluation of the property or site under the NRHP criteria (located at 36 CFR § 60.4 ) and consultation with the relevant State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) regarding the historic significance of the property or site and whether the planned modifications will adversely affect the property or site, including any associated historic district. ii) Depending upon the nature of the review, consultation with additional parties (e.g., Native American Tribes, Native Hawaiian Organizations, local governments) may be required by 36 CFR § 800.4(d)(2) .", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_80_236756041", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The SHPO’s response may consist of a statement of no objection or concurrence with SBA’s determination; an objection to SBA’s determination; or a request for additional information. iv) After receiving the SHPO’s response, local SBA counsel will consult with the Associate General Counsel for Litigation or designee and advise the SBA Lender of the next steps in the review. d) If consultation with the SHPO results in a determination that the property or site does not satisfy the NRHP criteria, or that the property or site satisfies the NRHP criteria but there will not be an adverse effect, local SBA counsel will receive an approval from the Associate General Counsel for Litigation or designee indicating that the SBA Loan transaction may proceed and will issue a Section 106 review clearance to the SBA Lender. e) SBA Lenders processing the loan under their delegated authority must retain the clearance from local SBA counsel in the SBA Loan file. The clearance must be provided with any guaranty purchase request and may be reviewed by SBA when conducting lender oversight activities. f) SBA Lenders processing the loan under non-delegated procedures must include the clearance from local SBA counsel with the application for review by the SBA loan processing center. g) If consultation with the SHPO results in a determination that the property or site satisfies the NRHP criteria and there will be an adverse effect, SBA must further consult with SHPO and, depending upon the review, other parties to resolve the adverse effect. This may result in a Memorandum of Agreement between SBA and SHPO, and other parties as applicable, regarding the resolution of the adverse effect. E. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SBA’s environmental policies and procedures apply to all SBA Lenders on all 7(a) and 504 loan programs, except where otherwise indicated. Environmental policies apply only to real estate acquired, refinanced, or improved by the loan proceeds. This section is not applicable to real estate collateral that is available from, for example, a lien filed for a loan where proceeds are not used to acquire, refinance, or improve the real estate. Definitions: Terms that are capitalized in this paragraph are defined in Appendix 4 . 1. Environmental Contamination Risks The risks of environmental Contamination include: The costs of Remediation could impair the Borrower’s ability to repay the loan and/or continue to operate the business;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_81_139786962", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

If the Borrower defaults, the SBA Lender or SBA might have to abandon the Property to avoid liability or accept a reduced price for the Property; The SBA Lender or SBA could be liable for environmental clean-up costs and third-party damage claims arising from Contamination if title to contaminated Property is taken as a result of foreclosure proceedings and/or the SBA Lender or SBA exercises operational control at the Property; and If a Governmental Entity cleans a site, it may be able to file a lien for recovery of its costs which may be superior to SBA’s lien. 2. Environmental Investigations SBA requires an Environmental Investigation of all commercial Property upon which a security interest such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or leasehold deed of trust is offered as security for a loan or debenture when SBA loan proceeds are used to acquire, refinance, or improve the real estate. The type and depth of an Environmental Investigation to be performed varies with the risks of Contamination. This paragraph provides minimum standards. Prudent lending practices and internal lending policy may dictate additional Environmental Investigations or safeguards. 3. Submission of Environmental Investigation Reports The SBA Lender must submit the Environmental Investigation Report to the SBA Center processing the application, except on loans processed under delegated authority, 7(a) Small Loans, SBA Express, and Export Express loans. SBA Lenders processing delegated, 7(a) Small Loans, SBA Express and Export Express loans do not have to submit Environmental Investigation Reports to the SBA Center, but they must keep a copy of any Environmental Investigation Report in the loan file. All SBA Lenders must comply with and meet the requirements of the Environmental Policies and Procedures as set forth in this SOP. For example, all Transaction Screens, Phase I and Phase II ESAs must be performed by an Environmental Professional and be accompanied by the Reliance Letter in Appendix 5 . (A Reliance Letter is required even if the Environmental Investigation Report is addressed to the SBA Lender.) Any request for an exception to SBA’s Environmental Policies and Procedures must be directed to the Environmental Committee, regardless of the method of processing used for the loan. 4. Environmental Investigation Steps NAICS Codes. For all Property except a unit in a Multi-Unit Building, the SBA Lender must begin by making a Good Faith effort to determine the NAICS code(s) for the Property’s current and known prior uses and compare the NAICS code(s) to the list of environmentally sensitive industries in Appendix 6. For a unit in a Multi-Unit Building, the SBA Lender may proceed directly to subparagraphs ii.a) and b) of this paragraph below. i.

If the Environmental Professional conducting the Phase I ESA concludes that no further investigation is warranted, the SBA Lender must submit the results of the Environmental Investigation to SBA with recommendations and seek SBA’s concurrence. If the Environmental Professional conducting the Phase I ESA concludes that further investigation is warranted (typically a Phase II), and the SBA Lender still wants to make the loan, the SBA Lender must proceed as recommended by the Environmental Professional, or in the alternative submit the results of the Environmental Investigation to the SBA with recommendations and seek SBA’s concurrence. In general, SBA will require compliance with all of an Environmental Professional’s recommendations (including “housekeeping measures,” such as secondary containment, decommissioning monitoring wells, sealing floor drains, etc.). ii.

Indemnification. If any Person (as defined in Appendix 4) who possesses sufficient financial resources to cover the costs of completing Remediation executes the SBA Environmental Indemnification Agreement in Appendix 8, approval or disbursement may be considered. The SBA Lender must conduct an analysis of the proposed indemnitor to ensure that it has sufficient assets to honor an indemnification agreement.

For 504 loans: All CDCs, including PCLP CDCs, must submit each finalized SBA Environmental Indemnification Agreement (located in Appendix 8 of this SOP) to the SLPC for review and approval no less than 2 weeks in advance of submission of the loan closing package if they want the loan to be considered in that closing cycle. ii. Completed Remediation. If the Governmental Entity has affirmed in writing that active Remediation is complete but additional monitoring is required, approval or disbursement may be considered after the following occurs: a) Monitoring results for the first year are obtained; b) An Environmental Professional concludes that the results show no unacceptable increase in Contamination since Remediation; and c) An Environmental Professional concludes that the owner/operator of the Property is in compliance with any continuing obligations, including activity and use limitations, Engineering and Institutional Controls, and post-Remedial monitoring required by the Governmental Entity. iii. No Further Action. If an SBA Lender obtains a “no further action letter” or “closure letter” from a Governmental Entity (or state equivalent of a “no further action letter” or “closure letter”) stating that no further Remediation or monitoring of Contamination previously found is required, approval or disbursement may be considered. A state equivalent of a closure letter includes a written determination from a licensed professional in those jurisdictions that delegate authority to such professionals for site closures. iv. Minimal Contamination with Minimal Remediation. If the extent of Contamination and cost of Remediation are de minimis in relation to the value of the Property and/or the resources of the Person responsible for Remediation, and the Remediation is projected to be completed within 1 year, approval or disbursement may be considered.

Clean-up Funds. If the SBA Lender provides evidence from a Governmental Entity that the Applicant or Property has been approved by a fund to pay for or reimburse Remediation costs, and the amount allocated is sufficient to cover the costs of Remediation, approval or disbursement may be considered. The SBA Lender must also address any conditions of Remediation that might preclude payment or reimbursement and the financial capability of the fund. vi. Escrow Account. If an escrow account is available that equals a minimum of 150 percent of the total estimated cost of required Remediation and is controlled by a 7(a) Lender or first mortgage holder in a 504 loan as trustee, approval or disbursement may be considered. The Governmental Entity must concur with the Remediation’s scope. The escrow agreement for the escrow account must ensure that escrow funds will only be used for Remediation costs. The source of the escrow funds may not be SBA Loan proceeds. Depending upon the circumstances, an escrow account with more than 150 percent of the estimated costs of Remediation may be appropriate. The escrowed funds may be used for Remediation. Any remaining funds in the account may not be released until the appropriate “closure letter” or “no further action letter” is received or, in the case of monitoring, when all monitoring wells related to the Property have been decommissioned. Note: The SBA Lender’s, or for 504 loans, the Third Party Lender’s role as trustee of the escrow account is solely to release funds upon the satisfactory completion of Remediation work – the SBA Lender or Third Party Lender must not control or manage the Property being remediated. vii. Contamination Originating from another Site. If Contamination on the Property is shown to have come from another property, approval or disbursement may be considered if: a) Another Person with sufficient resources is performing Remediation pursuant to a Remediation action plan that has been approved by the appropriate Governmental Entity; or b) The state has laws or regulations that provide that an owner or operator of property will not be responsible for Contamination from another site; or c) The Governmental Entity provides satisfactory written assurance that it will not hold the Property owner liable for the Contamination. The SBA Lender should attempt to have the SBA Lender and SBA included by name in the letter along with the Property owner and future purchasers. viii. Additional or Substitute Collateral. If additional or substitute collateral is being pledged, or an additional equity contribution is being made, sufficient to overcome the potential loss due to Contamination, then approval or disbursement may be considered.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_87_406694609", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The SBA Lender and SBA may rely on factors other than or in addition to the eight referenced above when considering approval or disbursement. For example, the existence of adequate environmental insurance that is already in place and already paying remediation costs, bonds, agreements not to sue present and future property owners from the Governmental Entity, brownfields agreements, Engineering and Institutional Controls, etc. However, reliance solely upon “Other Factor(s)” requires clearance from the SBA Environmental Committee. This requirement extends to loans processed under delegated authority (PLP, SBA Express, Export Express, and PCLP). For 7(a) loans processed under delegated authority, including 7(a) Small Loans, SBA Express and Export Express, 7(a) Lenders must follow these guidelines, but they do not have to submit documentation or obtain SBA’s concurrence prior to approval or disbursement of the loan, unless they are relying solely upon paragraph d.ix, Other Factor(s) immediately above. 6. Special Use Facilities Child-Occupied Facilities Prudent lending practices dictate that specific additional environmental assessments be performed for Child-Occupied Facilities (see definition in Appendix 3). Such facilities, constructed prior to 1978, must undergo a lead risk assessment and also testing for lead in drinking water at all taps and fountains potentially used as a drinking water source for children. A new lead risk assessment and new testing for lead in drinking water at all indoor and outdoor taps and fountains accessible to children and therefore potentially used as a drinking water source for children are required for each new loan. The assessment and any tests must have been conducted within one year of submission of the reports to SBA or reliance upon the report by a Lender utilizing its delegated authority. All lead assessments must be conducted in conformance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations at 40 CFR 745 and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing Second Edition, July 2012. The results of these assessments must be submitted to the SBA. Disbursement will not be authorized unless the risk of lead exposure to infants and small children has been sufficiently minimized. Drycleaners On-site dry cleaning facilities, which may have utilized chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) and/or petroleum-based solvents in the course of their business operations, may present significant clean- up costs if these contaminants have entered the soil, soil vapor and/or groundwater. Prudent lending practices dictate and SBA requires that for any Property with on- site dry cleaning facilities, whether currently in operation or operated historically at the site, that uses, used, or likely used chlorinated and/or petroleum-based solvents, a Phase I followed by a Phase II Environmental Assessment is required. (Any deviation from this requirement must be directed to", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_88_44280634", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

For on- site dry cleaners, the investigation must address soil, groundwater, and soil vapor. A Phase II performed in connection with an on-site dry cleaning facility must be conducted by an independent Environmental Professional who holds a current Professional Engineer’s or Professional Geologist’s license and has the equivalent of 3 years of full time relevant experience. Gasoline Stations Gasoline stations also present significant clean-up costs if contaminated (for specific requirements pertaining to gasoline stations, please refer to Appendix 7). 7. Release of Rights to Indemnification from SBA/Lender If any Person has a right to indemnification from subsequent owners of the Property (e.g., SBA or SBA Lender after acquiring Property through foreclosure or other means), then they must execute either the SBA Indemnification Agreement or another document in which they waive all known and unknown rights and release all claims and causes of action whether now or hereafter in existence against SBA and the SBA Lender related to Contamination at the Property including the right to indemnification. The document containing the waiver and release must be recorded. Additionally, for 504 loans: SBA Lenders must submit all waiver and release documents to the SBA center processing the loan for review and approval by local SBA counsel, along with a copy of the title report, the document providing for indemnification, and the purchase and sale documents, if any. PCLP CDCs must also submit the waiver and release to the SBA for review and approval prior to a request that SBA fund the loan. 8. Brownfields Sites SBA encourages the redevelopment of brownfields, and SBA Loan guarantees are available to small businesses interested in locating on revitalized brownfields. Typically, this occurs through utilization of one or more of the nine Mitigating Factors in paragraph 5.d. above. 9. Questions on SBA’s Environmental Policy and Appeals Questions on SBA’s Environmental Policy should be directed to local SBA counsel for the area where the Property is located. SBA Lenders who believe that an environmental decision that has been rendered by SBA is inconsistent with this SOP may appeal the decision by forwarding a copy of the decision, along with an explanation of how the determination is perceived to be inconsistent with this SOP to EnvironmentalAppeals@sba.gov. (NOTE: This email address cannot receive submissions larger than 15MB. If the email and attachments exceed this size, the appeal must be sent in more than one email.) Environmental appeals, including exceptions to Agency environmental policy, will be reviewed by the SBA Environmental Committee comprised of OGC attorneys appointed by the Associate General Counsel for Litigation, who may consult with an environmental engineer.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE CREDIT PROGRAMS The SBA’s lending programs qualify as “Special-Purpose Credit Programs” under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). This regulation stipulates that information pertaining to the Applicant’s marital status, sources of personal income, alimony, child support, and spouse’s financial resources can be obtained and considered in determining program eligibility.

These loans may be processed under Preferred Lender Program (PLP) authority or non- delegated through the Loan Guaranty Processing Center (LGPC). Lenders must always start by reviewing the contents of Section A, Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans. A. ELIGIBLE USES OF PROCEEDS In addition to the eligible uses of proceeds in the Core requirements, Standard 7(a) Loans may use loan proceeds for: 1. Debt Refinancing 13 CFR §§ 120.140(j)(1) and 120.201 SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds may not be used to pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss (including the same institution’s debt). This includes any refinancing that will shift all or part of a potential loss from the original lender to the SBA. The debt to be refinanced must be, and must have been, current for at least the last 12 months or for the life of the loan, whichever is less. “Current” means that a required payment has not remained unpaid for more than 29 days. A loan that has matured and not been paid within 29 days of the maturity date is not current and is not eligible for refinancing. Loan proceeds may be used to refinance the following types of business debt (see paragraph c. below for additional requirements if refinancing same institution debt). i. Any debt structured with a demand note or balloon payment; ii. Debt with an interest rate that exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate based on size or term; iii. Credit Card Debt Used for Business Expenses - The Applicant must certify that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business and were not used for any ineligible purpose as set forth in 13 CFR § 120.130. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from credit card debt where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request. The Lender can rely on the Applicant certification; iv.

Revolving lines of credit (short-term or long-term) where the original lender is unwilling to renew the line, or the Applicant is restructuring its financing in order to obtain a lower interest rate or longer term; vi. Debt with a maturity that was not appropriate for the purpose of the financing (e.g., a 3 year term loan to finance a piece of equipment with a useful life of 15 years); vii. Debt used to finance a change of ownership of a going concern business; a) To be eligible for refinancing, any seller financed note must have been in place and current (not on standby) for at least 24 months following the change of ownership. The refinancing request must meet the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below. b) If the change of ownership is between existing owners of a business and existing business debt will be refinanced as part of the transaction, the refinancing must meet the requirements set forth in this section. c) If the existing debt is SBA-guaranteed and with the same Lender Same Institution Debt (SID), the application can be processed under PLP authority. d) Paying off debt as part of a change of ownership is not a refinance of debt. In a complete change of ownership situation, the option to assume the existing SBA debt should be offered to the buyer. viii. Debt reflected on the Applicant’s business balance sheet is eligible for refinancing if the Applicant certified that the debt is reflected on the Applicant’s business tax returns (Schedule C for sole proprietorships) showing the interest expense associated with the debt. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from debt on the Applicant’s business balance sheet where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request. The 7(a) Lender may rely on the Applicant certification. ix. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC): If the debt is in the form of a HELOC, the Applicant must certify that the amount being refinanced was used exclusively for business. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from debt in the form of a HELOC where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request.

If other debt is being refinanced at the same time, such debt may be included in the installment payment improvement calculation. If the note terms include an escalating payment structure, the new installment amount must be at least 10 percent less than the expected installment amount within the next 12 months.

Interim Advances: For loans processed on a delegated or non-delegated basis, after the loan has received an SBA loan number and prior to disbursement, a Lender or an affiliate of the Lender may make interim advances (also known as bridge loans) and 7(a) loan proceeds may be used to reimburse the interim advances. Lender notification to SBA of such advances is not required. 2. Change of Ownership (13 CFR § 120.202) A Borrower(s) (and any individual Co-Borrower as permitted under this paragraph), may use loan proceeds for a change of ownership, whether the change of ownership is accomplished through a stock purchase (including a stock redemption) or an asset purchase, only under the circumstances described under this paragraph. An asset purchase will be deemed a change of ownership and must comply with all of the requirements of this paragraph if the Applicant(s) is purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of the seller’s business and is continuing the operations of the seller’s business. The following requirements apply: The change of ownership must promote the sound development and/or preserve the existence of a small business; An SBA-guaranteed loan cannot be made solely to an individual. The small business must be either the Borrower or a Co-Borrower; The maximum 7(a) loan uses of proceeds for any change of ownership is capped at the business valuation amount. When the business valuation is lower than the sales agreement, any financed capital required to meet the shortfall (in addition to the 7(a) loan and any equity injection) must be subordinate to the 7(a) loan. Seller earnouts/buyer rebates: Seller earnouts are prohibited; however, buyer rebates based on business performance are allowed because this is a benefit to the Borrower. If the Borrower receives funds based on the rebate, it should first be applied to pay down the 7(a) loan to a point that will not trigger a subsidy recoupment fee, and any remaining funds may be used for business purposes;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_96_949960497", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If a short transitional period is needed to assist the business, the small business may contract with the seller as a consultant for a period not to exceed 12 months including any extensions. The seller may stay on as an owner, officer, director, stockholder or employee of the business or the ESOP when: i. One or more of the current owners is selling less than their entire percentage of their current ownership (partial change of ownership); or ii. The purchaser is an ESOP or equivalent trust or a cooperative and is acquiring a controlling interest (51% or more) in the employer business (including when the ESOP or equivalent trust or cooperative is acquiring 100% ownership of the small business). Change of Ownership Resulting in a New Owner (complete change of ownership): A change of ownership resulting in a new owner may be financed under the following circumstances: i. A small business is purchasing 100% of the ownership interest in another business. The acquiring entity will be the Borrower. If, however, the business being acquired will continue to exist as a separate entity, the acquiring entity and the small business being acquired must be Co-Borrowers.

An individual(s) who is not an existing owner is purchasing 100% of the ownership interest in the small business. The small business and the individual owner(s) who is acquiring the ownership interest must be Co- Borrowers. In addition, the Note must be executed, jointly and severally, by both the individual(s) who acquires the ownership interest(s) and the small business whose ownership interest is being acquired. If the small business denies liability for the debt based on an alleged failure of consideration under applicable state law, SBA may deny liability on its guaranty. iii. A small business is acquiring another small business through an asset purchase. The acquiring entity will be the Borrower.

Change of Ownership Between Existing Owners (complete partner buyout): A change of ownership between existing owners may be financed under the following circumstances: i. One or more current owners is purchasing the entire interest of another current owner, resulting in 100% ownership of the business by the remaining owner(s). The small business and the individual owner(s) who is acquiring the ownership interest must be Co-Borrowers.

Maximum Loan Amount Standard 7(a) Loans have a maximum of $5,000,000. Maximum Loans to Businesses with Affiliates 13 CFR § 120.151 Lenders must determine whether the Applicant has any affiliates and document the results in their credit analysis. If affiliation exists, SBA’s loan maximums apply to the Applicant, including all affiliates, as if all were a single business. 2. Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages The maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business and its affiliates must not exceed $3,750,000 (13 CFR 121.151). SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount and any existing 7(a) or 504 loans, including revolving lines of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.” The maximum guaranty amount is $3,750,000. The maximum guaranty percentage is: i. 85% for loans of $150,000 or less ii. 75% for loans over $150,000 Combination of 7(a) and 504 loans. i. When an Applicant applies for any combination of 7(a) and 504 loans, the order in which the loans are approved determines the maximum loan and guaranty amount available. Because the 7(a) loan has a lower maximum guaranteed amount, the 7(a) loan should be processed and approved first. ii. Lenders must advise the SBA processing centers that there is a companion 504 application to ensure the 7(a) loan is processed and approved prior to the 504 loan application being processed and approved. Maximum Guaranty Percentage for Multiple 7(a) Loans (13 CFR § 120.210). For multiple 7(a) loans approved within 90 days of each other, the gross dollar amounts of the loans are combined. If the combined gross amount exceeds $150,000, then the percentage of guaranty on the combined loans must not be more than 75 percent (subject to the $3,750,000 limit). For example, if a business receives an 85 percent guaranty on a loan of $140,000 and submits a second application for $50,000 within 90 days of the first loan’s approval, the percentage of guaranty on the second loan must be reduced to 47 percent so the combined guaranty is no more than $142,500, or 75 percent of the total amount of both loans ($190,000).

Loan Maturities 13 CFR § 120.212 7(a) loans must have a stated maturity. The loan term must be the shortest appropriate term based on the use of proceeds and the Borrower's ability to repay. A loan’s term must be: Working capital or inventory loans and the financing of intangible assets (including goodwill) must not exceed 10 years. Generally, equipment, fixtures, or furniture loans should not exceed 10 years. However, the term may be up to 15 years if the IRS asset class useful life supports the term. The term for a loan to finance equipment and/or leasehold improvements may include an additional reasonable period, not to exceed 12 months, when necessary to complete the installation of the equipment and/or complete the leasehold improvements. Real estate loans (including acquisition, rehabilitation, renovation, construction, or improvements to leasehold interests in land) must not exceed 25 years, unless a portion of the loan is used for construction or renovation of the real estate. If the use of proceeds on a real estate loan includes construction or renovation, an additional period reasonably necessary for the construction or renovation period may be added to the 25-year maximum maturity. Loans for leasehold improvements (except for leasehold interests in land) may not exceed 10 years, plus an additional period reasonably necessary to complete the leasehold improvements, as determined based on the specific nature of the leasehold improvements, but in no case more than 12 months. Mixed purpose loans: When loan proceeds are used for multiple purposes (land and building, working capital, machinery & equipment, or the refinancing of any of these purposes), the maturity may be a blended maturity or, if 51% or more of the use of proceeds are for real estate, the maximum maturity may be up to 25 years. Loan maturity for changes of ownership: i. For a complete change of ownership: Only when the purchase price includes the commercial real estate from which the Applicant business operates (i.e., is not investment or personal real estate) and when the value of the commercial real estate is 51% or more of the purchase price, the loan may have a maximum maturity of 25 years. Otherwise, the maximum maturity is 10 years. ii. For a complete partner buyout or for a partial change of ownership: This is, by its nature, a transaction based on the redemption or sale of stock for equity in the business; therefore, the loan maturity is limited to a maximum of 10 years. 4.

A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The maximum interest rate that may be established for any 7(a) loan is governed by SBA’s regulations on interest rates, which preempts any provisions of a state’s constitution or law. The Lender negotiates the interest rate with the Applicant, subject to SBA’s maximum allowable rates. ii. SBA will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the Federal Register. The maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be the Prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month, plus an allowable spread over Prime, as set forth in the most recent Federal Register Notice . For a listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates, go to SBA’s Fiscal Transfer Agent (FTA) Wiki. The maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by a Lender if such rate will be in effect for the entire term of the loan, without adjustment or reset. Otherwise, the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply. iii. For variable interest rate loans, the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by SBA during that month. (Note: The date the “complete loan application is received by SBA” is the date the loan is approved and assigned an SBA loan number (for both delegated and non- delegated processing)). The initial note rate must not exceed SBA’s maximum interest rate. The basis for the SBA maximum interest rate is an acceptable base rate plus allowable spread. The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. iv. Default interest rates are not permitted. v.

This rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month. If a website is used, please ensure whether it is publishing the current day’s rate or the previous day’s rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day’s rate. The Optional Peg Rate is a weighted average of rates the Federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average 7(a) loan. SBA calculates and publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register. Base Rates will be rounded to two decimal places with .004 being rounded down to .00 and .005 being rounded up to .01. b) Frequency of change; c) Range of fluctuation; and d) Ceiling and floor (if any). vi. After approval and prior to final disbursement, Lender must either notify the LGPC of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing.

The 7(a) Lender may not split a loan into two loans for the purpose of charging a higher interest rate to the Applicant. Base Rate, Allowable Spread, and Allowable Variance (13 CFR § 120.214): i. A loan may have a variable interest rate. The base rate may be one of the following: a) The Prime Rate; or b) The SBA Optional Peg rate. ii. The allowable spread is based on the loan amount. a) Loans of $50,000 and less: Base rate + 6.5%; b) Loans of $50,001 up to and including $250,000: Base rate + 6%; c) Loans of $250,001 up to and including $350,000: Base rate + 4.5%; d) Loans of $350,001 and higher: Base rate + 3%. iii.

Standard Policy: SBA’s maximum allowable interest rate applies only to the initial Note rate on a variable rate loan. Subsequent changes in the base rate are not subject to the maximum rate at the time of loan application; however, the maximum spread over the base cannot exceed SBA’s stated maximum. ii. Post-Approval Changes to the Interest Rate: a) Pre-Disbursement Changes: After loan approval and prior to first disbursement, the Lender may change the initial Note rate, including changing the base rate, the spread over the base rate, or change from a fixed rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, provided the new interest rate does not exceed the maximum allowable interest rate at the time of the loan application. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must either notify the LGPC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed. The Borrower has asked the Lender if the loan can be switched to a fixed rate. If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan application, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. b) Post-Disbursement Changes: After the loan is disbursed, on a variable rate loan, the Lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate as long as the new base rate or spread is based on a method permitted when the loan was approved and is consistent with the interest rate regulations at the time the loan was approved. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written agreement and must either notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For further guidance see SOP 50 57 . iii. Frequency of Interest Rate Adjustment: a) The first adjustment may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month. Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period. For example, Lenders have used periods as long as 5 years in order to provide the Borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first 5 years of the loan. After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. b) The Lender must specify in the Note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_104_52077507", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

All subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period. iii) The rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period. For example, if the first of the month is a Sunday, the base rate is the prime rate in effect on Monday. This rate will be reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, the third calendar day and second business day of the month. Many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period, especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the Secondary Market. c) After the interest rate begins fluctuating, the loan can be re-amortized. Typically, loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. iv. Interest Rate Requirements for an SBA Note: a) For fixed rate loans, the Lender must state the specific interest rate in the Note. b) For variable rate loans, the Lender must include the following information in the Note: i) Identification of the rate being used as the base rate; ii) The publication in which the designated base rate appears regularly (e.g., Wall Street Journal or the Federal Register if using the SBA Optional Peg Rate); iii) The percentage spread, including any changes to percentage spread if applicable, to be added to the base rate (e.g., in a construction loan); iv) The initial interest rate of the loan (from disbursement to first adjustment); v) The date or timing of the first rate adjustment; and vi) The frequency of rate adjustment. v. Interest Rate Ceilings and Floors: SBA will permit a Lender to limit the upward and downward adjustments by establishing a floor and ceiling provided that: a) Both the floor and ceiling are stated in the Note; and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_105_798426018", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

For example, if the Note rate is 10% and the ceiling is 12%, the floor must be 8% or lower. vi. Accrual Method: SBA does not require a specific accrual method, unless the loan is sold in the Secondary Market. Loans sold on the Secondary Market must either use 30/360 or Actual/365 as the interest accrual methods. While the interest accrual method 365/360 is permitted on loans not sold on the Secondary Market, Lenders are cautioned that they cannot use this accrual method and charge the maximum allowable rate of interest because this will result in an Annual Percentage Rate that exceeds SBA’s regulatory maximum. vii. Amortization: (13 CFR § 120.214(e) ): Lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan. SBA does not allow balloon payments. A fixed interest rate loan must use a payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. Typically, variable rate loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. The amortization schedule may also be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business. Fixed and Variable Rate Combinations: The Lender may use a fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and a variable rate on the other portion of the loan. SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a variable interest rate on the unguaranteed portion and sell a fixed rate guaranteed portion on the secondary market. If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: i. An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties where one party pays a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount. The contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan. The swap contract only relates to the payment of interest. Example: A Borrower has a prime plus 2% interest rate on a 7(a) variable rate guaranteed loan. The Borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at 8%. When the Note rate is lower than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract (8%), the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk that rates will at some point exceed 8%. When the Note rate is higher than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract, the Borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of 8% and the swap seller would pay the difference above 8% to the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_106_187730336", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the Borrower of an interest rate swap contract. ii. In order to use an interest rate swap in the 7(a) program, the interest rate swap contract must meet the following conditions: a) The interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business Borrower and the Lender or, if the swap seller is not the lender, a third party. SBA is not a party to the interest rate swap contract. b) The interest rate swap contract does not affect the amount of money owed by the Borrower to SBA in the event SBA purchases the guaranty. In the event of a Borrower default, interest will be calculated using the base rate and spread in the variable interest rate Note, not the swap contract. c) SBA will not be responsible if the swap seller defaults during the life of the contract. The Borrower will be liable for the interest as required in the Note. d) Loans with accompanying interest rate swap contracts may be sold on the Secondary Market. The Lender is still required under the Secondary Market contract (SBA Form 1086) to forward interest and principal pursuant to the original terms of the loan. It is the Lender’s responsibility to work with the swap seller to make sure funds are available for submission to the fiscal and transfer agent according to the time schedule in the Form 1086. e) The full amount of the principal and interest required under the Note must be reported by the lender on the SBA Form 1502 . f) SBA will not review swap contracts for Borrowers or provide guidance on their use. While swap contracts should not have a significant impact on the cost of the loan, SBA will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts. g) The Borrower must sign a statement acknowledging that interest will be calculated at the Note rate if the swap contract is terminated. h) The following statement must be included in the swap contract that is executed by the Borrower and the swap seller: “The Small Business Administration is not a party to this contract and does not guarantee it. In the event SBA is called upon to honor its guaranty to the Lender, the Borrower’s debt will be determined by the terms of the Note, including the variable interest rate provision.” i) Swap contracts may be used on new or existing loans. j) The swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the loan agreement. k) SBA does not have a standard form for an interest rate swap contract.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_107_674239456", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

C. CREDIT STANDARDS The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150. This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA. A Lender must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment, not any expected recovery from the liquidation of collateral. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. 1. Processing Methods Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened-out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its PLP Authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s PLP authority for a period of 12 months from the date of the withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. Non-delegated – When a Lender submits a Standard 7(a) loan guaranty request under the non-delegated processing method, the Lender submits the application and supporting documents to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan, and any equity contribution to be required from the Applicant. PLP – When a Lender submits a Standard 7(a) loan guaranty request under the Lender’s PLP authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The PLP Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. 2. Underwriting Standard 7(a) Loans (Loans greater than $500,000): Lender’s Credit Analysis: The Lender’s credit memorandum and analysis must address the Applicant’s ability and likelihood to repay the loan from the cash flow of the business and past performance by documenting the following: i.

Equity requirements (13 CFR § 120.150): Except for transactions for changes in ownership as stated below, Lender’s requirement for equity and equity injection must be consistent with its requirements for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. However, the Lender may use its discretion to reduce the amount of equity and/or equity injection required if it determines that the Applicant needs leverage that exceeds the Lender’s conventional requirements. i. Changes of ownership: a) Resulting in a new owner (complete change of ownership): At a minimum, SBA requires an equity injection of at least 10 percent of the total project costs, (all costs required to complete the change of ownership, regardless of the source of funds) for such transactions. i) Seller debt may not be considered as part of the equity injection unless the seller’s loan does not include a balloon payment and, for the first 24 months of the 7(a) loan, the seller debt is on: (a) Full standby; or (b) Partial standby (interest payments only being made) and the Applicant’s historical business cash flow supports the ability to make the payments, and at least a quarter of the SBA-required equity injection is from a source other than the seller. Note: Equity injection is new cash or other acceptable assets added into the project that is not on the Applicant’s balance sheet prior to the equity injection. ii) When an existing business starts or acquires a business that is in the same 6 digit NAICS code with identical ownership and in the same geographic area as the acquiring entity and they are co-borrowers, SBA considers this to be a business expansion, and SBA will not", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_111_541944756", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Lender must include in the credit memorandum confirmation that the Borrower has made the required certification and retain such certification in the file. ii) The business balance sheets for the most recent completed fiscal year and current quarter must reflect a debt-to-worth ratio of no greater than 9:1 prior to the change in ownership. iii) In the event the Lender is unable to document that both i) and ii) above are satisfied, the remaining owner(s) must contribute cash either sufficient to reflect a debt-to-worth ratio of no greater than 9:1 on the pro forma balance sheet or in the amount of at least 10% of the purchase price of the business, as reflected in the purchase and sale agreement, whichever is less. c) Partial changes of ownership (Changes of ownership other than complete changes of ownership or complete partner buyouts): i) The business balance sheets for the most recent completed fiscal year and current quarter must reflect a debt-to-worth ratio of no greater than 9:1 prior to the change in ownership. ii) In the event the Lender is unable to document that i) above is satisfied, the borrowers must contribute cash either sufficient to reflect a debt- to-worth ratio of no greater than 9:1 on the pro forma balance sheet or in the amount of at least 10% of the purchase price of the business, as reflected in the purchase and sale agreement, whichever is less. ii. Source of Equity Injection: If the Lender or SBA requires an equity injection, the Lender must use the same processes to verify the equity injection as it uses for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. 3.

A Lender may not take any action in connection with an SBA-guaranteed loan that establishes a preference in favor of the Lender (13 CFR § 120.411). The Lender must not have a 7(a) loan in a “piggyback” structure. a) Piggyback financing occurs when one or more lenders provide more than one loan to a single Borrower at or about the same time, financing the same or similar purpose, and where the SBA-guaranteed loan is secured with a junior lien position or no lien position on the collateral securing the non-guaranteed loan(s). SBA considers “at or about the same time” to mean loans approved within 90 days of each other. b) SBA does not consider a scenario where both the SBA-guaranteed loan and the non-SBA guaranteed loan are for working capital and the non- SBA guaranteed loan is secured only by working/trading assets to be a piggyback structure. c) SBA does not consider a shared lien position with the lender (pari passu) to be a piggyback structure when the maturity of the non-SBA guaranteed loan is not shorter than the maturity of the SBA-guaranteed loan. ii. A loan request is not to be declined solely on the basis of inadequate collateral. In fact, one of the primary reasons Lenders use the SBA- guaranteed program is for those Applicants that demonstrate repayment ability but lack adequate collateral to repay the loan in full in the event of default. However, SBA does not permit its guaranty to be a substitute for available collateral. Collateral Requirements for Standard 7(a) Loans. i. SBA considers a loan as “fully secured” if the Lender has taken security interests in all assets being acquired, refinanced, or improved with the 7(a) loan and available fixed assets of the Applicant with a combined Net Book Value as adjusted below, up to the loan amount. For 7(a) loans, the term “fixed assets” means real estate, including land and structures, machinery and equipment owned by the business or an EPC. a) New machinery and equipment (excluding furniture and fixtures) may be valued at no more than 75% of price minus any prior liens for the calculation of “fully secured”; b) Used or existing machinery and equipment (excluding furniture & fixtures) may be valued at no more than 50% of Net Book Value or 80% with an Orderly Liquidation Appraisal minus any prior liens for the calculation of “fully secured”; c) Improved real estate can be valued at no more than 85% and unimproved real estate can be valued at 50% of the market value for the calculation of “fully secured” and the value must be determined in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraph C.3.d, Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements below; and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_113_571051686", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If there is a collateral shortfall (not “fully secured”) on the SBA-guaranteed loan the Lender: a) Must take available equity in the personal real estate (residential and investment property, including other commercial real estate) of any owners of 20% or more of the Applicant and guarantors except Supplemental Guarantors. Liens on personal real estate may be limited to the amount of the collateral shortfall. In addition, liens on personal real estate may be limited to 150% of the equity in the collateral. b) May include trading assets as necessary (using no more than 10% of current book value for the calculation). iii. SBA does not require a Lender to collateralize a loan with real estate (including commercial, residential and investment properties owned by the Applicant or personally by the owners) to meet the “fully secured” definition when the equity in the real estate is less than 25% of the property’s fair market value. The Lender must document in their loan file the source (other than the personal financial statement) for making the determination of less than 25% equity. iv. When loan proceeds from a Standard 7(a) Loan will be used to acquire, refinance, or improve assets, a first security interest in those assets must be obtained. v. For loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate that was acquired, refinanced, or improved with proceeds of the loan, Lenders must obtain an appraisal that complies with Paragraph C.3.d., Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements, below, and with Section A, Ch. 5, Para. E, Environmental Policies and Procedures . Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements The regulation governing real estate appraisal is set forth at 13 CFR § 120.160(b). i. Commercial Real Estate: a) For all Standard 7(a) loans secured by commercial real property, all Lenders must obtain an appraisal by a State licensed or certified appraiser. Appraisals must be in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Additionally, SBA requires that completed appraisals be dated within 12 months of the application for guaranty. For federally-regulated Lenders, no exemption is granted under the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines dated December 2, 2010, for Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_114_579991391", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender may not use an appraisal prepared for the seller or the Applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Applicant. d) The appraisal must be an “Appraisal Report” prepared in compliance with USPAP. e) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.) After construction is completed, Lender must obtain a statement from the appraiser, general contractor, project architect, or construction management firm that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based. If the Lender cannot obtain such a statement, then the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission. f) If the SBA-guaranteed loan was used to cover the construction period, the Lender must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any deviation(s) and work with the SBA CLSC to determine an appropriate course of action, including the securing of additional collateral. The Lender’s notification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral.

If the appraiser estimates the value other than on an as-is basis, the narrative must include an explanation of why the as-is basis was not used. h) When valuing the collateral, the Lender must not include the contributory value of any rental income or the value of any intangible assets contained in the appraisal. i) An appraisal may be submitted as part of the loan application to assist with the underwriting or as part of the loan closing. In no case may the Lender rely on an appraisal that was prepared more than 12 months prior to the date of the application. j) If the Lender is going to require the appraisal at closing, the loan application must include an estimate of the value of the real estate and the estimate must be identified in the credit memorandum with the requirement for an appraisal that supports the estimated value at time of closing. k) If at time of closing the appraised value: i) Is 90% or more of the estimated value, the Lender may close the loan but must include a written explanation as to why the appraisal is less than the estimated value in the loan file; or ii) Is less than 90% of estimated value, the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission (see exception below for PLP Lenders). The Lender’s justification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. iii) Exception for PLP Lenders: PLP Lenders are permitted to close a loan when the appraisal is less than 90% of the estimated value but the Lender must include a written justification as part of its file that may be reviewed by SBA at time of guaranty purchase or when conducting lender oversight activities. The justification must include a thorough analysis by the Lender of the reasons for the appraisal being low and an explanation as to what steps the Lender took to offset the risk to SBA from the low appraisal such as additional equity or additional collateral. ii.

Other Fixed Assets: If the valuation of fixed assets is greater than their Net Book Value, an independent appraisal by a qualified individual must be obtained by the Lender to support the higher valuation. The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. A valuation of the fixed assets provided as part of a business valuation will not meet these requirements, except as part of a going concern appraisal. iv. Additional Appraisal Requirements for all Changes of Ownership: For businesses that have been transferred within 36 months prior to the date of the loan application, SBA requires: a) An appraisal of the business real estate that meets the appraisal requirements above; and b) Either a “review” of the appraisal by another appraiser selected directly by the Lender or a site visit by a senior member of the Lender’s staff. The Lender must document the file and include the date of the visit and a description of the items reviewed on site. v. Business Valuation Requirements – Change of Ownership: a) Determining the value of a business (not including real estate which is separately valued through a real estate appraisal) is the key component to the analysis of any loan application for a change of ownership. An accurate business valuation is required because the change in ownership will result in new debt unrelated to business operations and potentially the creation of intangible assets. A business valuation assists the buyer in making a determination that the seller’s asking price is supported by an independent Qualified Source (see definition in Appendix 3). b) In order for the individual performing the business valuation to identify the scope of work appropriately, the business valuation must be requested by and prepared for the Lender. The scope of work should identify whether the transaction is an asset purchase or stock purchase and be specific enough for the individual performing the business valuation to know what is included in the sale (including any assumed debt). The business valuation must include the individual’s conclusion of value, the qualifications of the individual performing the business valuation and their signature certifying to the information contained in the business valuation. The Lender may not use a business valuation prepared for the Applicant or the seller.

D. SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION FOR GUARANTY The contents of the Lender’s application for guaranty vary depending on the size of the loan and the method of processing chosen by the Lender, but in all cases Lender must maintain any and all documents that the Lender collects to support the guaranty request in their loan files. Lender must list in E-Tran all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant. SBA Form 1919 includes information on the number of existing employees at the time of application and the number of jobs to be created and/or retained as a result of the loan. • Number of existing employees at the time of application is calculated in accordance with 13 CFR § 121.106 , which states in part that SBA counts all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis (i.e., jobs are not converted to full-time equivalents). • Jobs “created” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees that the small business expects to hire as a result of the loan. • Jobs “retained” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees on the payroll of the business at the time of application that will be lost if the loan is not approved. • “Employees” does not include contractors reported via IRS Form 1099.

Contents of Lender’s Application for Guaranty & Submission to SBA Regardless of the processing method (delegated or non-delegated), all 7(a) loan files must include the forms and information the Lender requires in order to make an informed credit decision. Any application form obtained by the Lender from the Applicant must be certified by the Applicant as true and complete. For all loans submitted using the Lender’s PLP delegated authority, Lender must submit the information required in SBA Form 1919 and the loan terms and conditions into E-Tran. For all loans submitted using the non-delegated process through the LGPC, the Lender must submit applications for guaranty and all attachments via E-Tran to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan, and any equity contribution to be required from the Applicant. SBA will either approve or decline the loan in E-Tran. The Lender must obtain and retain in its file all documentation listed below. In addition, Lender must submit as part of the application for guaranty those items below emphasized in bold. Lender must submit to E-Tran all terms and conditions required by E-Tran data fields. SBA Form 1919: A separate SBA Form 1919 for each co-borrower must be completed and signed by the authorized representative of the Applicant and submitted to the Lender. The aggregate amounts of the “Purpose of the loan” sections across all SBA Forms 1919 should equal the total amount of the loan request. Only the information required on SBA Form 1919, and not the form itself, must be submitted into E-Tran, although the Lender must obtain and retain the signed form in its file. Lender’s Credit Memorandum must address all requirements detailed in paragraph C, Credit Standards in this chapter. Owner Financial Statement (business or personal, as applicable) signed and dated within 120 days of submission to SBA, for all owners of 20% or more (including the assets of the owner’s spouse and minor children), and proposed guarantors, except Supplemental Guarantors. Lenders may use SBA Form 413 or their own equivalent form. If the Lender requires owner financial statements for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed loans, these statements must be submitted to LGPC as part of the application. If the Lender uses a credit score to evaluate the owner financials then the Lender does not need to obtain owner financial statements for either delegated or non-delegated loans.

Non-delegated applications – Lenders submitting applications using non- delegated procedures (including loans from PLP Lenders) must submit applications for guaranty and all attachments via E-Tran to the LGPC. Documents greater than 250MB must be separated into multiple documents. The system does not support uploads greater than 250MB. PLP applications – Lenders submitting applications using their PLP authority must submit guaranty applications via E-Tran, retaining all required documentation in the Lender’s loan file. Reconsideration of Declined non-delegated Standard 7(a) Loan Applications (13 CFR § 120.193): i. If the Lender believes the reason(s) for decline have been overcome, a request for reconsideration may be submitted along with a detailed written explanation of how the Applicant has overcome the reason(s) for decline. Lender must submit a request for reconsideration to the LGPC within 6 months of the date of decline. Any request submitted more than 120 days after the date of decline must include current financial statements. ii. If a request for reconsideration is declined by the LGPC, a second reconsideration may be requested from the D/FA or designee, whose decision is final. The request to the D/FA or designee must be submitted to the LGPC and must include a copy of the Center’s decline letter and include additional information that specifically addresses the reason(s) identified for decline and how the Applicant has overcome those reason(s).

SBA Express loans are loans that are $500,000 or less and may only be made by a Lender with SBA Express authority. SBA Express Lenders may not request that an SBA Express loan be processed under non-delegated authority by SBA’s LGPC. SBA Express was established as a permanent SBA program under P.L.108-447 and signed into law on December 8, 2004. The program reduces the number of government mandated forms and procedures, streamlines the processing, and reduces the cost of smaller, less complex SBA loans. The program allows Lenders to use, to the maximum extent practicable, their respective loan analyses, procedures, and documentation. Lenders must always start by reviewing the contents of Section A, Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans. A. ELIGIBLE USES OF PROCEEDS Lenders must apply and comply with all of SBA’s Loan Program Requirements, including the Core Requirements in Section A of this SOP. Loan proceeds must be used exclusively for business-related purposes subject to 13 CFR §§ 120.120 and 120.130 In addition to the Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans identified in Section A of this SOP, loan proceeds may be used for: 1. Debt Refinancing 13 CFR §§ 120.140(j)(1) and 120.201 SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds may not be used to pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss (including the same institution’s debt). This includes any refinancing that will shift all or part of a potential loss from the original lender to the SBA. The debt to be refinanced must be, and must have been, current for at least the last 12 months or for the life of the loan, whichever is less. “Current” means that a required payment has not remained unpaid for more than 29 days. A loan that has matured and not been paid within 29 days of the maturity date is not current and is not eligible for refinancing. Loan proceeds may be used to refinance the following types of business debt (see paragraph c. below for additional requirements if refinancing same institution debt). i.

Credit Card Debt Used for Business Expenses - The Applicant must certify that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business and were not used for any ineligible purpose as set forth in 13 CFR § 120.130. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from credit card debt where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request. The Lender can rely on the Applicant certification; iv. Debt that is over-collateralized based on SBA’s collateral requirements–- see paragraph C.3, Collateral below, which describes SBA’s collateral requirements used to determine if a loan is “fully secured;” v. Revolving lines of credit (short-term or long-term) where the original lender is unwilling to renew the line, or the Applicant is restructuring its financing in order to obtain a lower interest rate or longer term; vi. Debt with a maturity that was not appropriate for the purpose of the financing (e.g., a 3 year term loan to finance a piece of equipment with a useful life of 15 years); vii. Debt used to finance a change of ownership of a going concern business; a) To be eligible for refinancing, any seller financed note must have been in place and current (not on standby) for at least 24 months following the change of ownership. The refinancing request must meet the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below. b) If the change of ownership is between existing owners of a business and existing business debt will be refinanced as part of the transaction, the refinancing must meet the requirements set forth in this section. c) If the existing debt is SBA-guaranteed and with the same Lender Same Institution Debt (SID), the application can be processed under delegated (PLP or SBA Express) authority. d) Paying off debt as part of a change of ownership is not a refinance of debt. In a complete change of ownership situation, the option to assume the existing SBA debt should be offered to the buyer. viii. Debt reflected on the Applicant’s business balance sheet is eligible for refinancing if the Applicant certified that the debt is reflected on the Applicant’s business tax returns (Schedule C for sole proprietorships) showing the interest expense associated with the debt.

The Lender may rely on the Applicant certification. ix. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC): If the debt is in the form of a HELOC, the Applicant must certify that the amount being refinanced was used exclusively for business. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from debt in the form of a HELOC where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but if the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request. The Lender may rely on the Applicant certification. x. A Lender may refinance an existing non-SBA-guaranteed loan or Borrower debt from another lender if the new loan meets the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below; however, the new 7(a) loan is not subject to SBA’s 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement if the debt to be refinanced is a revolving line of credit. A Lender may refinance its own non-SBA guaranteed loan to the Applicant if the new loan meets the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below. Additionally, in accordance with 13 CFR § 120.452, a Lender may not use PLP delegated authority to reduce the Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant. Therefore, loans that reduce a Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant must be processed under non-PLP delegated authority, which may include processing the loan under SBA Express. A Lender may refinance its own or another Lender’s existing SBA-guaranteed loan to the Applicant: i. In accordance with 13 CFR § 120.452, a Lender may not use PLP delegated authority to reduce the Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant. 7(a) Small loans that reduce a Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant must be processed under non-delegated authority. However, SBA Express Lenders may process loans that reduce the SBA Express Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant under SBA Express authority. ii. Refinancing an SBA 7(a) loan. a) The new loan will meet the 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below. b) Any applicable subsidy recoupment fees will apply. iii. Refinancing an SBA 504 loan. Refinancing an existing 504 loan is permitted if: a) The loan meets the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph d. below, and b) The justification to refinance the existing 504 loan must be included in the credit memorandum.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_125_542233794", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Ten Percent Improvement to Installment Payment Amount. With the exception of debt (short-term or long-term) structured with a demand note or balloon payment, credit card obligations and HELOC used for business-related purposes, and revolving lines of credit (short-term or long-term) where the original lender is unable or unwilling to renew the line or the Applicant is restructuring its financing in order to obtain a lower interest rate or longer term, when refinancing debt, the new installment payment amount must be at least 10 percent less than the existing installment amount(s). If other debt is being refinanced at the same time, such debt may be included in the installment payment improvement calculation. If the note terms include an escalating payment structure, the new installment amount must be at least 10 percent less than the expected installment amount within the next 12 months. Lenders must avoid any circumstances that could create a possible conflict of interest. Refinancing a same institution commercial loan is not on its face considered a possible conflict of interest, provided all Loan Program Requirements are followed. Other conditions that apply to debt refinancing: i. A 7(a) loan may not be used to refinance a debt owed to a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) or a New Markets Venture Capital Company 13 CFR § 120.130(b) . ii. The payment of trade payables is not considered to be debt refinancing. iii. For loans processed under a Lender’s PLP authority, SBA does not consider the following to be refinancing SID: a) The debt is an interim loan that has been made for other than real estate construction purposes and was approved by the Lender within 90 days prior to the issuance of an SBA loan number; or b) The debt is a construction loan that has not been disbursed at the time the SBA loan number is issued. Interim Advances: For loans processed on a delegated or non-delegated basis, after the loan has received an SBA loan number and prior to disbursement, a Lender or an affiliate of the Lender may make interim advances (also known as bridge loans) and 7(a) loan proceeds may be used to reimburse the interim advances. Lender notification to SBA of such advances is not required. 2. Change of Ownership (13 CFR § 120.202) A Borrower(s) (and any individual Co-Borrower as permitted under this paragraph), may use loan proceeds for a change of ownership, whether the change of ownership is accomplished through a stock purchase (including a stock redemption) or an asset", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_126_701586879", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

An asset purchase will be deemed a change of ownership and must comply with all of the requirements of this paragraph if the Applicant(s) is purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of the seller’s business and is continuing the operations of the seller’s business. The following requirements apply: The change of ownership must promote the sound development and/or preserve the existence of a small business; An SBA-guaranteed loan cannot be made solely to an individual. The small business must be either the Borrower or a Co-Borrower; The maximum 7(a) loan uses of proceeds for any change of ownership is capped at the business valuation amount. When the business valuation is lower than the sales agreement, any financed capital required to meet the shortfall (in addition to the 7(a) loan and any equity injection) must be subordinate to the 7(a) loan.. Seller earnouts/buyer rebates: Seller earnouts are prohibited; however, buyer rebates based on business performance are allowed because this is a benefit to the Borrower. If the Borrower receives funds based on the rebate, it should first be applied to pay down the 7(a) loan to a point that will not trigger a subsidy recoupment fee, and any remaining funds may be used for business purposes; Except as provided below, the seller may not remain as an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of the business. If a short transitional period is needed to assist the business, the small business may contract with the seller as a consultant for a period not to exceed 12 months including any extensions. The seller may stay on as an owner, officer, director, stockholder or employee of the business or the ESOP when: i. One or more of the current owners is selling less than their entire percentage of their current ownership (partial change of ownership); or ii. The purchaser is an ESOP or equivalent trust or a cooperative and is acquiring a controlling interest (51% or more) in the employer business (including when the ESOP or equivalent trust or cooperative is acquiring 100% ownership of the small business). Change of Ownership Resulting in a New Owner (complete change of ownership): A change of ownership resulting in a new owner may be financed under the following circumstances: i. A small business is purchasing 100% of the ownership interest in another business. The acquiring entity will be the Borrower. If, however, the business being acquired will continue to exist as a separate entity, the acquiring entity and the small business being acquired must be Co-Borrowers.

(Note: any transaction costs associated with making the loan to the ESOP or equivalent trust, but not the costs associated with setting up the trust, may be included in the use of proceeds.)

Maximum Loan Amount 7(a) Small loans have a maximum loan amount of $500,000 per project (including other 7(a) loans made within 90 days). The maximum aggregate SBA Express loan amount is $500,000, (gross) inclusive of all outstanding SBA Express, Community Advantage, Community Express, and Patriot Express loans the Applicant and its Affiliates may have. 7(a) Small loans are not included in this limit. Maximum Loans to Businesses with Affiliates. 13 CFR § 120.151 Lenders must determine whether the Applicant has any affiliates and document the results in their credit analysis. If affiliation exists, SBA’s loan maximums apply to the Applicant, including all Affiliates, as if all were a single business. 2. Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages The maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business (including affiliates) must not exceed $3,750,000. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount for a revolving line of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.”", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_130_968311132", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The maximum guaranty percentage is: i. For 7(a) Small loans: a) 85% for loans of $150,000 or less b) 75% for loans over $150,000 ii. For SBA Express loans: 50%. Combination of 7(a) and 504 loans. i. When an Applicant applies for any combination of 7(a) and 504 loans, the order in which the loans are approved determines the maximum loan and guaranty amount available. Because the 7(a) loan has a lower maximum guaranteed amount, the 7(a) loan should be processed and approved first. ii. Lenders must advise the SBA processing centers that there is a companion 504 application to ensure that the 7(a) loan is processed and approved prior to the 504 loan application being processed and approved. Zero Percent Guaranty Cannot be Provided for Ineligible Purposes: A 7(a) loan cannot include proceeds for an ineligible purpose or have any portion of the loan made to an ineligible business and no part of a 7(a) loan may be guaranteed at zero percent. 3. Loan Maturities 13 CFR § 120.212 7(a) loans must have a stated maturity. The loan term must be the shortest appropriate term based on the use of proceeds and the Borrower's ability to repay. i. For 7(a) Small loans and SBA Express term loans, the loan’s term must be: a) Working capital or inventory loans and the financing of intangible assets (including goodwill) must not exceed 10 years. b) Generally, equipment, fixtures, or furniture loans should not exceed 10 years. However, the term may be up to 15 years if the IRS asset class useful life supports the term. The term for a loan to finance equipment and/or leasehold improvements may include an additional reasonable period, not to exceed 12 months, when necessary to complete the installation of the equipment and/or complete the leasehold improvements. c) Real estate loans (including acquisition, rehabilitation, renovation, construction, or improvements to leasehold interests in land) must not exceed 25 years, unless a portion of the loan is used for construction or renovation of the real estate.

Otherwise, the maximum maturity is 10 years. ii) For a complete partner buyout or for a partial change of ownership: This is, by its nature, a transaction based on the redemption or sale of stock for equity in the business; therefore, the loan maturity is limited to a maximum of 10 years. ii. SBA Express lines of credit: a) May not exceed 10 years inclusive of a term-out period. b) Revolving loans: i) Revolving loans of more than 12 months must be structured with a term-out period that is not less than the draw period, with no draws permitted during the term-out period. Under no circumstances may there be any advances after the initial 60 month period. For example, the loan can have an 8 year maturity with a 2 year draw period and a term-out period of 6 years. Conversely, a loan with an 8 year maturity cannot have a draw period of 6 years and term-out period of 2 years. ii) May be established as renewable each year, provided they do not exceed the maximum maturity.

SBA Express Non-Financial Default Provisions: Non-financial default provisions are allowed under SBA Express under the following conditions: Non-financial default provisions are loan conditions that, if violated, would cause the loan to be in default even though the Borrower has made all payments as agreed. Non-financial default provisions must be substantive and must be agreed to by the Borrower in writing at loan closing; The provisions must be consistent with those used by the Lender on its similarly- sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans; A lender may not request purchase of the guaranty solely based on a violation of a non-financial default provision (see 13 CFR § 120.520); and A maturity date must be established in the note. For example, a line of credit could state that it is payable upon demand under certain conditions, but in no case later than a certain date. 5. Interest Rates SBA QUICK REFERENCE CHART: Maximum Interest Rates Allowed (See additional information below) Product 7(a) Small and SBA Express Loans Interest Rate The published maximum allowable fixed rate or if variable: Loans $50,000 or less Cannot exceed Prime or SBA Optional Peg Rate + 6.5% Loans $50,001 up to and including $250,000 Cannot exceed Prime or SBA Optional Peg Rate + 6.0% Loans $250,001 up to and including $350,000 Cannot exceed Prime or SBA Optional Peg Rate + 4.5% Loans $350,001 up to and including $500,000 Cannot exceed Prime or SBA Optional Peg Rate + 3.0% General Policy on Interest Rates (13 CFR § 120.213): i. A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The maximum interest rate that may be established for any 7(a) loan is governed by SBA’s regulations on interest rates, which preempts any provisions of a state’s constitution or law.

SBA will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the Federal Register. The maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be the Prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month, plus an allowable spread over Prime, as set forth in the most recent Federal Register Notice . For a listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates, go to SBA’s FTA Wiki. The maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by a Lender if such rate will be in effect for the entire term of the loan, without adjustment or reset. Otherwise, the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply. iii. For variable interest rate loans, the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by SBA during that month. (Note: The date the “complete loan application is received by SBA” is the date the loan is approved and assigned an SBA loan number.) The initial note rate must not exceed SBA’s maximum interest rate. The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. iv. For loans with a variable interest rate, the following terms must be defined in E-Tran and the Note: a) Base Rate 13 CFR 120.214(c) : i) For 7(a) Small loans, there are two acceptable base rates: (a) The Prime Rate; or (b) The SBA Optional Peg Rate. ii) The Prime Rate will be that rate which is in effect on the first business day of the month, as identified in a national financial newspaper or website. This rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month. If a website is used, please ensure whether it is publishing the current day’s rate or the previous day’s rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day’s rate. The Optional Peg Rate is a weighted average of rates the Federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average 7(a) loan. SBA calculates and publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register. Base Rates will be rounded to two decimal places with .004 being rounded down to .00 and .005 being rounded up to .01. iii) For SBA Express variable rate loans, the Lender is not required to use the base rate identified above in this paragraph and in 13 CFR § 120.214(c). It may use the same ba se rate of interest it uses on its similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, as well as its established change intervals, payment accruals, etc. However, the interest rate throughout the term of the loan may not exceed the maximum allowable 7(a) interest rate.

For 7(a) Small loans and SBA Express: After approval and prior to final disbursement, Lender must either notify the LGPC of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. After final disbursement, Lender must either notify the appropriate Commercial Loan Servicing Center of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. vi. The Lender may not split a loan into two loans for the purpose of charging a higher interest rate to the Applicant. vii. Default Interest Rates: a) 7(a) Small loans: Default interest rates are not permitted. b) SBA Express loans: The default interest rate is a change (increase) in the interest rate charged to the Borrower as a result of a failure to meet certain conditions specified in the loan agreement. A Lender may charge a default interest rate if it does so for its similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, as long as the interest rate does not exceed the amounts permitted for SBA Express loans. The amount of interest SBA will pay to a Lender following default of an SBA Express loan is capped at the maximum interest rates for the Standard 7(a) loan program. Base Rate, Allowable Spread, and Allowable Variance (13 CFR § 120.214): i. A loan may have a variable interest rate. ii. For 7(a) Small loans, the allowable spread is based on the loan amount. a) Loans of $50,000 and less: Base rate + 6.5%; b) Loans of $50,001 up to and including $250,000: Base rate + 6%; c) Loans of $250,001 up to and including $350,000: Base rate + 4.5%; d) Loans of $350,001 and higher: Base rate + 3%. iii.

Subsequent changes in the base rate are not subject to the maximum rate at the time of loan application; however, the maximum spread over the base cannot exceed SBA’s stated maximum. ii. Post-Approval Changes to the Interest Rate: a) Pre-Disbursement Changes: After loan approval and prior to first disbursement, the Lender may change the initial Note rate, including changing the base rate, the spread over the base rate, or change from a fixed rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, provided the new interest rate does not exceed the maximum allowable interest rate at the time of the loan application. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must either notify the LGPC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed. The Borrower has asked the Lender if the loan can be switched to a fixed rate. If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan application, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. b) Post-Disbursement Changes: After the loan is disbursed, on a variable rate loan, the Lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate as long as the new base rate or spread is based on a method permitted when the loan was approved and is consistent with the interest rate regulations at the time the loan was approved. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written agreement and must either notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For further guidance see SOP 50 57 . iii. Frequency of Interest Rate Adjustment: a) For 7(a) Small loans, the first adjustment may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month. Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period. For example, Lenders have used periods as long as 5 years in order to provide the Borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first 5 years of the loan. After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. b) SBA Express Lenders are permitted to use the same change intervals used on their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period.

After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. c) The Lender must specify in the Note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur. i) This adjustment period as identified in the Note may not be changed without the written consent of the Borrower. ii) All subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period. For 7(a) Small loans, subsequent adjustments may occur no more frequently than monthly. iii) The rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period. For example, if the first of the month is a Sunday, the base rate is the prime rate in effect on Monday. This rate will be reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, the third calendar day and second business day of the month. Many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period, especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the Secondary Market. d) After the interest rate begins fluctuating, the loan can be re-amortized. Typically, loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. iv. Interest Rate Requirements for an SBA Note: a) For fixed rate loans, the Lender must state the specific interest rate in the Note. b) For variable rate loans, the Lender must include the following information in the Note: i) Identification of the rate being used as the base rate; ii) The publication in which the designated base rate appears regularly (e.g., Wall Street Journal or the Federal Register if using the SBA Optional Peg Rate); iii) The percentage spread, including any changes to percentage spread if applicable, to be added to the base rate (e.g., in a construction loan); iv) The initial interest rate of the loan (from disbursement to first adjustment); v) The date or timing of the first rate adjustment; and vi) The frequency of rate adjustment. v.

For example, if the Note rate is 10% and the ceiling is 12%, the floor must be 8% or lower. b) For SBA Express loans: SBA will permit a Lender to limit the upward and downward adjustments by establishing a floor and ceiling provided that both the floor and ceiling are stated in the Note. vi. Accrual Method: SBA does not require a specific accrual method, unless the loan is sold in the Secondary Market. Loans sold on the Secondary Market must either use 30/360 or Actual/365 as the interest accrual method. vii. Amortization 13 CFR § 120.214(e) : Lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan. SBA does not allow balloon payments. A fixed interest rate loan must use a payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. Typically, variable rate loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. The amortization schedule may also be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business. Fixed and Variable Rate Combinations: The Lender may use a fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and a variable rate on the other portion of the loan. SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a variable interest rate on the unguaranteed portion and sell a fixed rate guaranteed portion on the Secondary Market. If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: i. An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties where one party pays a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount. The contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan. The swap contract only relates to the payment of interest. Example: A Borrower has a prime plus 2% interest rate on a 7(a) variable rate guaranteed loan. The Borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at 8%. When the Note rate is lower than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract (8%), the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk that rates will at some point exceed 8%. When the Note rate is higher than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract, the Borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of 8% and the swap seller would pay the difference above 8% to the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_138_292880565", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the Borrower of an interest rate swap contract. ii. In order to use an interest rate swap in the 7(a) program, the interest rate swap contract must meet the following conditions: a) The interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business Borrower and the Lender or, if the swap seller is not the lender, a third party. SBA is not a party to the interest rate swap contract. b) The interest rate swap contract does not affect the amount of money owed by the Borrower to SBA in the event SBA purchases the guaranty. In the event of a Borrower default, interest will be calculated using the base rate and spread in the variable interest rate Note, not the swap contract. c) SBA will not be responsible if the swap seller defaults during the life of the contract. The Borrower will be liable for the interest as required in the Note. d) Loans with accompanying interest rate swap contracts may be sold on the Secondary Market. The Lender is still required under the Secondary Market contract (SBA Form 1086) to forward interest and principal pursuant to the original terms of the loan. It is the Lender’s responsibility to work with the swap seller to make sure funds are available for submission to the fiscal and transfer agent according to the time schedule in the Form 1086. e) The full amount of the principal and interest required under the Note must be reported by the lender on the SBA Form 1502 . f) SBA will not review swap contracts for Borrowers or provide guidance on their use. While swap contracts should not have a significant impact on the cost of the loan, SBA will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts. g) The Borrower must sign a statement acknowledging that interest will be calculated at the Note rate if the swap contract is terminated. h) The following statement must be included in the swap contract that is executed by the Borrower and the swap seller: “The Small Business Administration is not a party to this contract and does not guarantee it. In the event SBA is called upon to honor its guaranty to the Lender, the Borrower’s debt will be determined by the terms of the Note, including the variable interest rate provision.” i) Swap contracts may be used on new or existing loans. j) The swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the loan agreement. k) SBA does not have a standard form for an interest rate swap contract.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_139_572115690", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

C. CREDIT STANDARDS FOR 7(A) SMALL LOANS & SBA EXPRESS The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150. This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA. A Lender must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment, not any expected recovery from the liquidation of collateral. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. To the maximum extent practicable, 7(a) Small and SBA Express Lenders may use their own forms, internal credit memoranda, notes, collateral documents, and servicing and liquidation documentation. In using their documents and procedures, Lenders must follow their established and proven internal procedures used for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. 1. Processing Method Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened-out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its delegated (PLP or SBA Express) authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s delegated (PLP or SBA Express) authority for a period of 12 months from the date of the withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. 7(a) Small loans: i. Non-delegated – When a Lender submits a loan guaranty request under the non-delegated processing method, the Lender submits the application and supporting documents to SBA. ii. PLP – When a Lender submits a loan guaranty request under the Lender’s PLP authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The PLP Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. SBA Express loans are only processed via an SBA Express Lender’s delegated authority. When a Lender submits an SBA Express loan guaranty request under the Lender’s SBA Express authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing an SBA Loan Number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file.

Underwriting 7(a) Small Loans: (Note: If any requested increase to a 7(a) Small Loan or SBA Express loan results in total 7(a) loan(s) in excess of $500,000 (including loans made within 90 days of another), the Lender must follow the underwriting procedures for Standard 7(a) loans.) i. All 7(a) Small Loan applications will begin with a screening for a FICO ® Small Business Scoring ServiceSM Score (SBSS Score). a) The SBSS Score is calculated based on a combination of consumer credit bureau data, business bureau data, Borrower financials, and application data (The SBSS Score is not to be confused with the Small Business Predictive Score (SBPS) used by SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management). The minimum credit score is based on the lower end of the risk profile of the current SBA portfolio. As of the effective date of this SOP, the minimum acceptable SBSS score is 155, but that score may be adjusted up or down from time to time. SBA will post on its website the minimum acceptable SBSS credit score for 7(a) Small Loan applications. b) If the Applicant receives an acceptable SBSS Score: i) Lenders processing the loan under non-delegated authority must submit the application via E-Tran. Once SBA issues the SBA loan number, the Lender may close and disburse the loan in accordance with the procedures in this SOP. ii) Lenders processing the loan under PLP authority may close and disburse the loan in accordance with the procedures in this SOP. c) If the Applicant does not receive an acceptable SBSS Score: i) Lenders may submit the application via E-Tran for processing under non-delegated procedures. The Lender’s credit memorandum must contain a cash flow analysis that demonstrates the Applicant can repay the loan through cashflow of the business. The cashflow analysis must include all business debt payments taking into account the effect of the new 7(a) loan. Once SBA issues the SBA loan number, the Lender may close and disburse the loan in accordance with the procedures in this SOP. ii) PLP Lenders may approve an application that does not receive an acceptable SBSS credit score using their PLP authority. PLP Lenders may override an unacceptable SBSS score by: (a) Completing a cashflow analysis that demonstrates the reasonable", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_141_719546002", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Lenders must document the cashflow analysis in the loan file. The cashflow analysis must include all business debt payments taking into account the effect of the new 7(a) loan. SBA will not deny the Lender request for loan guaranty based solely upon the Lender’s decision to use its PLP authority to underwrite the cashflow of the business; or (b) Using the Lender’s business credit scoring model in accordance with paragraph b. below; or (c) Lenders with SBA Express authority may process the loan under their SBA Express authority. For 7(a) Small and SBA Express loans: Lenders must use appropriate, prudent, and generally accepted industry credit analysis processes and procedures (which may include credit scoring), and these procedures must be consistent with those used for the Lender’s similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Lenders may use a business credit scoring model (such a model cannot rely solely on consumer credit scores) to assess character, reputation, and credit history of the applicant and/or repayment ability if they do so for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. i. The business credit scoring model may only be used in addition to the Lender’s appropriate, prudent, and generally accepted industry credit analysis and procedures. ii. If used, the business credit scoring results must be documented in each loan file and available for SBA review. iii. Lenders must validate (and document) with appropriate and accepted statistical methodologies that their business credit scoring model is predictive of loan performance and they must provide that documentation to SBA upon request. iv. Although SBLCs do not make non-SBA guaranteed loans, SBA has determined they may use credit scoring. SBLCs are required to provide credit scoring model validation to SBA on an annual basis. For 7(a) Small and SBA Express loans, the credit decision, including how much to factor in a past bankruptcy or whether to require an equity injection, is left to the business judgment of the Lender. Also, if the Lender requires an equity injection and, as part of its standard processes for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans verifies the equity injection, it must do so for its 7(a) Small and SBA Express loans. While the credit decision is left to the business judgment of the Lender, early loan defaults will be reviewed by SBA pursuant to SOP 50 57. 3.

Decisions regarding what collateral must be taken to secure a loan are based on the circumstances of the individual loan, including size, and must meet the minimum requirements set forth in this section. i. For loans of $50,000 or less, Lenders are not required to take collateral. ii. For loans over $50,000, the Lender must follow the written collateral policies and procedures that it has established and implemented for its similarly- sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, except that SBA does not require a Lender to place a lien on non-business assets such as personal homes even if it is the Lender’s policy to do so. A loan request is not to be declined solely on the basis of inadequate collateral. In fact, one of the primary reasons Lenders use the SBA-guaranteed program is for those Applicants that demonstrate repayment ability but lack adequate collateral to repay the loan in full in the event of default. However, SBA does not permit its guaranty to be used as a substitute for available collateral. At a minimum, Lenders must follow the Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements stated in paragraph b. below. iii. A Lender may not take any action in connection with an SBA-guaranteed loan that establishes a preference in favor of the Lender (13 CFR § 120.411 ). The Lender must not have a 7(a) loan in a “piggyback” structure. a) Piggyback financing occurs when one or more lenders provide more than one loan to a single Borrower at or about the same time, financing the same or similar purpose, and where the SBA-guaranteed loan is secured with a junior lien position or no lien position on the collateral securing the non-guaranteed loan(s). SBA considers “at or about the same time” to mean loans approved within 90 days of each other. b) SBA does not consider a scenario where both the SBA-guaranteed loan and the non-SBA guaranteed loan are for working capital and the non- SBA guaranteed loan is secured only by working/trading assets to be a piggyback structure. c) SBA does not consider a shared lien position with the lender (pari passu) to be a piggyback structure when the maturity of the non-SBA guaranteed loan is not shorter than the maturity of the SBA-guaranteed loan. Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements The regulation governing real estate appraisal is set forth at 13 CFR § 120.160(b). i.

Appraisals must be in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Additionally, SBA requires that completed appraisals be dated within 12 months of the application for guaranty. ii) If an appraisal is not required under the preceding paragraph, all Lenders must obtain an appropriate evaluation of the commercial real estate securing the loan that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Evaluations are not required to be performed in accordance with USPAP or by State licensed or certified appraisers but should be consistent with the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines and the Interagency Advisory on the Use of Evaluations in Real Estate-Related Financial Transactions, issued by the Federal Banking Regulators. b) The appraiser must be: i) Independent and have no appearance of a conflict of interest (such as a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the property or transaction, independent of the loan production function, and not involved in the approval of the transaction); and ii) Either State-licensed or State-certified, with the following exception: when the commercial property’s estimated value is over $1,000,000, the appraiser must be State-certified. c) In order for the appraiser to identify the scope of work appropriately, the appraisal must identify the Lender as the client and/or an intended user of the appraisal, as those terms are defined in USPAP, except that federally-regulated Lenders may follow their primary regulator’s FIRREA requirements to the extent they permit otherwise. The Lender may not use an appraisal prepared for the seller or the Applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Applicant. d) The appraisal must be an “Appraisal Report” prepared in compliance with USPAP. e) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.) After construction is completed, Lender must obtain a statement from the appraiser, general contractor, project architect, or construction management firm that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_144_604444204", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the Lender cannot obtain such a statement, then the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission. f) If the SBA-guaranteed loan was used to cover the construction period, the Lender must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any deviation(s) and work with the SBA CLSC to determine an appropriate course of action, including the securing of additional collateral. The Lender’s notification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. If the Lender is unable to obtain a statement that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based, but is able to obtain a new appraisal demonstrating that the market value meets or exceeds the original estimate of value, then no additional action on the part of the Lender is necessary. g) If the loan will be used to acquire an existing building that does not require construction, the appraiser should estimate market value on an as-is basis. If the appraiser estimates the value other than on an as-is basis, the narrative must include an explanation of why the as-is basis was not used. h) When valuing the collateral, the Lender must not include the contributory value of any rental income or the value of any intangible assets contained in the appraisal. i) An appraisal may be obtained as part of the loan application to assist with the underwriting or as part of the loan closing. In no case may the Lender rely on an appraisal that was prepared more than 12 months prior to the date of the application. j) If the Lender is going to require the appraisal at closing, the loan application must include an estimate of the value of the real estate and the estimate must be identified in the Lender’s credit memorandum with the requirement for an appraisal that supports the estimated value at time of closing. k) If at time of closing the appraised value: i) Is 90% or more of the estimated value, the Lender may close the loan but must include a written explanation as to why the appraisal is less than the estimated value in the loan file; or ii) Is less than 90% of the estimated value, Lenders are permitted to close the loan, but the Lender must include a written justification as part of its file that may be reviewed by SBA at time of guaranty purchase or", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_145_878750230", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The justification must include a thorough analysis by the Lender of the reasons for the appraisal being low and an explanation as to what steps the Lender took to offset the risk to SBA from the low appraisal such as additional equity or additional collateral. ii. Non-commercial real estate or real estate securing a personal guaranty: SBA has no specific appraisal requirements for non-commercial real estate (such as a residence) or real estate (commercial or non-commercial) taken as collateral to secure a personal guaranty. iii. Other Fixed Assets: If the valuation of fixed assets is greater than their Net Book Value , an independent appraisal by a qualified individual must be obtained by the Lender to support the higher valuation. The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. A valuation of the fixed assets provided as part of a business valuation will not meet these requirements, except as part of a going concern appraisal. iv. Business Valuation Requirements – Change of Ownership: a) Determining the value of a business (not including real estate which is separately valued through a real estate appraisal) is the key component to the analysis of any loan application for a change of ownership. An accurate business valuation is required because the change in ownership will result in new debt unrelated to business operations and potentially the creation of intangible assets. A business valuation assists the buyer in making a determination that the seller’s asking price is supported by an independent Qualified Source (See definition in Appendix 3). b) In order for the individual performing the business valuation to identify the scope of work appropriately, the business valuation must be requested by and prepared for the Lender. The scope of work should identify whether the transaction is an asset purchase or stock purchase and be specific enough for the individual performing the business valuation to know what is included in the sale (including any assumed debt). The business valuation must include the individual’s conclusion of value, the qualifications of the individual performing the business valuation and their signature certifying to the information contained in the business valuation. The Lender may not use a business valuation prepared for the Applicant or the seller. The cost of the business valuation may be passed on to the Applicant. i) Non-Special Purpose Properties: (a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_146_627004413", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

(a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the Lender’s internal policies and procedures require an independent business valuation from a Qualified Source.

The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. (c) The business valuation must allocate separate values to the individual components of the transaction including land, building, equipment, and intangible assets.

If the Lender requests the business valuation after issuance of an SBA Loan Number, the credit memorandum must include an estimate of the value of the business. The credit memorandum must be updated after receipt of the business valuation to include a comparison of the loan amount and the business valuation. iv) Any amount(s) of the loan proceeds that will be used to facilitate a change of ownership may not exceed the business valuation. v) Lender Verification of Business valuation Financial Data: Lender must obtain a copy of the financial information relied upon by the individual who performed the business valuation and verify that information against the seller’s IRS transcripts to ensure the accuracy of the information. D. SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION FOR GUARANTY 1. Contents of Lender’s Application for Guaranty Lender must submit to E-Tran all terms and conditions required by E-Tran data fields. Lender must list in E-Tran all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant, and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant. SBA Form 1919 includes information on the number of existing employees at the time of application and the number of jobs to be created and/or retained as a result of the loan. • Number of existing employees at the time of application is calculated in accordance with 13 CFR § 121.106 , which states in part that SBA counts all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis (i.e., jobs are not converted to full-time equivalents). • Jobs “created” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees that the small business expects to hire as a result of the loan. • Jobs “retained” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees on the payroll of the business at the time of application that will be lost if the loan is not approved. • “Employees” does not include contractors reported via IRS Form 1099. Processing: Program forms can be found at www.sba.gov/document. All loan files must include the forms and information the Lender requires in order to make an informed credit decision. Any application form obtained by the Lender from the Applicant must be certified by the Applicant as true and complete.

Where to Submit Applications for Guaranty Lenders must submit guaranty applications via E-Tran, retaining all required documentation in the Lender’s loan file. Once submitted to LGPC for non-delegated review, or to SLPC if a 504 loan, an application withdrawn by the Lender, screened-out, or declined by LGPC or SLPC may not be approved by any Lender under its SBA Express authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application (or any application inadvertently submitted to LGPC for review) under any Lender’s SBA Express authority for a period of 12 months from the date of withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. 3. Reconsideration of Declined Non-Delegated 7(a) Small Loan Applications (13 CFR § 120.193 ): If the Lender believes the reason(s) for decline have been overcome, a request for reconsideration may be submitted along with a detailed written explanation of how the Applicant has overcome the reason(s) for decline. Lender must submit a request for reconsideration to the LGPC within 6 months of the date of decline. If a request for reconsideration is declined by the LGPC, a second reconsideration may be requested from the D/FA or designee, whose decision is final. The request to the D/FA or designee must be submitted to the LGPC and must include a copy of the Center’s decline letter and include additional information that specifically addresses the reason(s) identified for decline and how the Applicant has overcome those reason(s). The LGPC will forward the request to the D/FA or designee for a final decision. 4.

Working Capital CAPLines Eligibility To be eligible for a Working Capital CAPLine, the Applicant must generate accounts receivable (not notes receivable), and/or have inventory. Eligible Uses of Proceeds i. Borrowers may only use the loan proceeds for short-term working capital/ operating needs. Proceeds must not be used to pay delinquent withholding taxes or similar funds held in trust (e.g., state or local sales taxes), or for floor plan financing. In the event that Working Capital CAPLine proceeds are used to acquire fixed assets, Lender must refinance the portion of the line used to acquire the fixed asset into an appropriate term facility no later than 90 days after Lender discovers that the line was used to finance a fixed asset. ii. Borrowers may be Exporters engaged in Export Transactions . Loan proceeds may be used for domestic-to-foreign exports, foreign-to-foreign exports, and indirect exports. Note: See paragraph B. 2 in this chapter for maximum guaranty amounts and percentages for CAPLines to Exporters, which are different than those for EWCP. iii. Debt Refinancing under Working Capital CAPLines a) In accordance with 13 CFR § 120.452, a Lender may not use PLP delegated authority to reduce the Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant. Loans that reduce a Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant must be processed under non-PLP delegated authority.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_151_754558163", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Be able to demonstrate prior prompt payments to suppliers and subcontractors. Eligible Uses of Proceeds 13 CFR 120.394 and 120.397 i. Borrowers must use the loan proceeds solely for direct expenses related to the construction and/or “substantial” renovation costs of a specific eligible project (residential or commercial buildings for resale), including labor, supplies, materials, equipment rental, direct fees (building permits, interim disbursement inspection fees, etc.), utility connections (above or below ground), construction of septic tanks, and landscaping. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of application.) ii. Proceeds paid to a subcontractor can include the subcontractor’s profit. The cost of land is eligible if the land cost does not exceed 33 percent of the project cost. Up to 5% of the project cost can be allocated for improvements that benefit all properties in a subdivision, such as streets, curbs, sidewalks, or open spaces. iii. Proceeds must not be used to: a) Purchase vacant land for possible future construction; b) Operate or hold rental property for future rehabilitation; or c) Refinance existing debt. A single line may be used to fund multiple projects.

SBA may allow the finished property to be rented pending sale only in cases where the rental will enhance the ability to sell the property. The final sale of the property must be an arm’s length transaction with legal transfer to an unaffiliated third party. 5. Restrictions that Apply to CAPLines Processed PLP The following types of CAPLines are not eligible under PLP processing: Loans to a cooperative or to an eligible small business owned or controlled by a cooperative (see Section A, Ch. 2, Para.

B.4., 401(k) Plans Including Rollovers as Business Start-Ups (ROBS) Plans, for more information). B. LOAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL CAPLINES 1. Maximum Loan Amount The maximum loan amount is $5,000,000. Maximum Loans to Businesses with Affiliates 13 CFR § 120.151 Lenders must determine whether the Applicant has any affiliates and document the results in their credit analysis. If affiliation exists, SBA’s loan maximums apply to the Applicant, including all affiliates, as if all were a single business. Working Capital CAPLines To determine the maximum line amount, the Lender must either: i. Follow its established policies and procedures used on its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit; or ii. Use the following formula: i) Divide Prior Year Net Sales by 365 to calculate the daily sales figure; ii) Multiply Daily Sales figure by number of days to finance (whatever number is the business sales cycle) The result will be the estimated working capital needs. Contract CAPLines i. For single contract financing with a single payment, the loan amount is equal to the sum of the costs of the contract (excluding profit), as evidenced by the project cost schedule. ii. For a single contract with multiple payments, the loan amount is the amount projected by the Borrower necessary to cover 20% over the greatest cash deficit projected for the subject contract. This permits the line to revolve within the term of the contract. iii. For multiple contract financing, the master note amount is equal to the sum of the costs of all contracts (excluding profit) to be financed under the CAPLine, as evidenced by the project cost schedules. For future projects not yet identified, at the time the contract is obtained all costs by line item should be identified. The amount of the sub-note for each specific contract should equal the total costs of that contract (excluding profit). Seasonal CAPLines The loan amount is based on the cash flow projections. The amount should correlate to the costs of the seasonal buildup of inventory and/or receivables.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_157_912983445", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

For a non-revolving loan, the loan amount is based on the written proposal of costs (not anticipated selling price) provided by the applicant for a single project. ii. For a revolving loan, the master note amount is based on the cash flow projection provided by the applicant for ALL work to be performed by the small business (not just a specific project). The amount of a sub-note (for each specific project) is based on the written proposal of costs (not anticipated selling price) provided by the Applicant for that particular project. 2. Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages The maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business (including affiliates) must not exceed $3,750,000, except when the loan is approved under a program which specifically permits higher amounts. When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount for a revolving line of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.” The maximum guaranty amount is $3,750,000. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. The maximum guaranty percentage is: i. 85% for loans of $150,000 or less ii. 75% for loans over $150,000 Combination of 7(a) and 504 loans. i. When an Applicant applies for any combination of 7(a) and 504 loans, the order in which the loans are approved determines the maximum loan and guaranty amount available. Because the 7(a) loan has a lower maximum guaranteed amount, the 7(a) loan should be processed and approved first. ii. Lenders must advise the SBA processing centers that there is a companion 504 application to ensure the 7(a) loan is processed and approved prior to the 504 loan application being processed and approved. Maximum Guaranty Percentage for Multiple 7(a) Loans (13 CFR § 120.210). For multiple 7(a) loans approved within 90 days of each other, the gross dollar amounts of the loans are combined. If the combined gross amount exceeds $150,000, then the percentage of guaranty on the combined loans must not be more than 75 percent (subject to the $3,750,000 limit). For example, if a business receives an 85 percent guaranty on a loan of $140,000 and submits a second application for $50,000 within 90 days of the first loan’s approval, the percentage of guaranty on the second loan must be reduced to 47 percent so the combined guaranty is no more than $142,500, or 75 percent of the total amount of both loans ($190,000).", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_158_26312173", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Loan Maturities 13 CFR § 120.212 The loan term must be the shortest appropriate term based on the use of proceeds and the Borrower’s ability to repay. Working Capital, Contract, and Seasonal CAPLines The maximum maturity on a Working Capital, Contract, or Seasonal CAPLine is 10 years. Any CAPLine with a maturity of less than 10 years can be renewed as long as the total revolving repayment period does not exceed 120 months. The renewal is an extension of maturity (not a new loan). Thus, the loan number remains the same. If the original maturity was for 12 months or less, and the new maturity exceeds 12 months, an additional guaranty fee will be due. See Section A, Ch. 5, Para. C.1.a.v., Additional Guaranty Fee for Extensions of Short- Term Loans. Builders CAPLines 13 CFR § 120.396 The loan must not exceed 60 months plus the estimated time to complete construction or rehabilitation. All CAPLines must have an exit strategy. Final disbursement should occur far enough in advance of maturity so that a sufficient amount of time is available for the assets acquired with proceeds to be converted back to cash and final payment. Contract, Seasonal, and Builders CAPLines that finance a single transaction should have a maturity tied to the seasonal cycle, contract completion date, or project completion date. Loan maturity must not exceed the period of the guaranty. 4.

A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The maximum interest rate that may be established for any 7(a) loan is governed by SBA’s regulations on interest rates, which preempts any provisions of a state’s constitution or law. The Lender negotiates the interest rate with the Applicant, subject to SBA’s maximum allowable rates. ii. SBA will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the Federal Register. The maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be the Prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month, plus an allowable spread over Prime, as set forth in the most recent Federal Register Notice . For a listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates, go to SBA’s FTA Wiki. The maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by a Lender if such rate will be in effect for the entire term of the loan, without adjustment or reset. Otherwise, the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply. iii. For variable interest rate loans, the basis for the SBA maximum interest rate is an acceptable base rate plus allowable spread. The base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by SBA during that month. (Note: The date the “complete loan application is received by SBA” is the date the loan is approved and assigned an SBA loan number (for both delegated and non-delegated processing.)) The initial note rate must not exceed SBA’s maximum interest rate. The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. For further discussion of variable interest rates, see “Policy on Variable Interest Rates” below. iv. Default interest rates are not permitted. v. For loans with a variable interest rate, the following terms must be defined in E-Tran and the Note: a) Base Rate and spread: i) There are two acceptable base rates: (a) The Prime Rate; or", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_160_682003649", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

This rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month. If a website is used, please ensure whether it is publishing the current day’s rate or the previous day’s rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day’s rate. The Optional Peg Rate is a weighted average of rates the Federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average 7(a) loan. SBA calculates and publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register. Base Rates will be rounded to two decimal places with .004 being rounded down to .00 and .005 being rounded up to .01. b) Frequency of change; c) Range of fluctuation; and d) Ceiling and floor (if any). vi. After approval and prior to final disbursement, Lender must either notify the LGPC of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. After final disbursement, Lender must either notify the appropriate Commercial Loan Servicing Center of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. vii. The 7(a) Lender may not split a loan into two loans for the purpose of charging a higher interest rate to the Applicant. Policy on Variable Interest Rates i. Standard Policy: SBA’s maximum allowable interest rate applies only to the initial Note rate on a variable rate loan. Subsequent changes in the base rate are not subject to the maximum rate at the time of loan application; however, the maximum spread over the base cannot exceed SBA’s stated maximum. ii. Post-Approval Changes to the Interest Rate: a) Pre-Disbursement Changes: After loan approval and prior to first disbursement, the Lender may change the initial Note rate, including changing the base rate, the spread over the base rate, or changed from a fixed rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, provided the new interest rate does not exceed the maximum allowable interest rate at the time of the loan application. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must notify the LGPC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed.

If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan application, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. b) Post-Disbursement Changes: After the loan is disbursed, on a variable rate loan, the Lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate as long as the new base rate or spread is based on a method permitted when the loan was approved and is consistent with the interest rate regulations at the time the loan was approved. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written agreement and must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For further guidance see SOP 50 57 . iii. Frequency of Interest Rate Adjustment: a) The first adjustment may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month. Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period. For example, Lenders have used periods as long as 5 years in order to provide the Borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first 5 years of the loan. After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. b) The Lender must specify in the Note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur. i) This adjustment period as identified in the Note may not be changed without the written consent of the Borrower. ii) Subsequent adjustments may occur no more frequently than monthly. All subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period. iii) The rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period. For example, if the first of the month is a Sunday, the base rate is the prime rate in effect on Monday. This rate will be reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, the third calendar day and second business day of the month. Many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period, especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the Secondary Market. c) After the interest rate begins fluctuating, the loan can be re-amortized.

Interest Rate Ceilings and Floors: SBA will permit a Lender to limit the upward and downward adjustments by establishing a floor and ceiling provided that: a) Both the floor and ceiling are stated in the Note; and b) The difference between the stated rate in the Note and the floor is equal to or greater than the difference between the stated rate in the Note and the ceiling. c) For example, if the Note rate is 10% and the ceiling is 12%, the floor must be 8% or lower. vi. Accrual Method: SBA does not require a specific accrual method, unless the loan is sold in the Secondary Market. Loans sold on the Secondary Market must either use 30/360 or Actual/365 as the interest accrual methods. While the interest accrual method 365/360 is permitted on loans not sold on the Secondary Market, Lenders are cautioned that they cannot use this accrual method and charge the maximum allowable rate of interest because this will result in an Annual Percentage Rate that exceeds SBA’s regulatory maximum. vii. Amortization: (13 CFR § 120.214(e) ): Lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan. SBA does not allow balloon payments. A fixed interest rate loan must use a payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. Typically, variable rate loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. The amortization schedule may also be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business.

SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a variable interest rate on the unguaranteed portion and sell a fixed rate guaranteed portion on the secondary market. If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. C. CREDIT STANDARDS FOR ALL CAPLINES The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150 . This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA. A Lender must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment. In CAPLines, the cash flow of the Applicant may include the conversion of assets to cash. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. 1. Processing Methods Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened-out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its PLP authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s PLP authority for a period of 12 months from the date of the withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. Non-delegated – When a Lender submits a CAPLine loan guaranty request under the non-delegated processing method, the Lender submits the application and supporting documents to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan and any equity contribution to be required from the Applicant. Delegated – When a Lender submits a CAPLine loan guaranty request under the Lender’s PLP authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The PLP Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. 2.

A description and history of the business, including: a) Nature of the business; b) Length of time in business under current management; c) Depth of management experience in the industry or a related industry; d) Brief description of the business’s management team including principal’s involvement in the daily onsite management of the business or how the daily operations will be managed if the principals are not there on a daily basis. ii.

Debt Service (DS) is defined as the future required principal and interest payments on all business debt inclusive of new SBA loan proceeds. The Applicant’s debt service coverage ratio (OCF/DS) must be equal to or greater than 1.15 on a historical and/or projected cash flow basis and 1:1 on a global basis. To perform a complete analysis of debt service, it is important for a Lender to obtain a current debt schedule prepared by the Applicant, including any shareholder debt. iv. For cash flow projections, the Lender must calculate the debt service coverage and provide the assumptions supporting the projected cash flow coverage, including as applicable: a) Justification for revenue growth, i.e., new product lines, sales channels, and new production facilities; b) Justification for any reduction in expenses; and c) A comparison to current industry trends. v.

Equity requirements (13 CFR § 120.150): Lender’s requirement for equity and equity injection must be consistent with its requirements for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. However, the Lender may use its discretion to reduce the amount of equity and/or equity injection required if it determines that the Applicant needs leverage that exceeds the Lender’s conventional requirements. Source of Equity Injection: If the Lender or SBA requires an equity injection, the Lender must use the same processes to verify the equity injection as it uses for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. 3. Collateral See Section A, Chapter 5, Paragraph A for guaranty requirements. General Collateral Requirements i. For loans of $50,000 or less, the Lender is not required to take collateral. (Guaranties still must be obtained in accordance with Section A, Ch. 5, Para. A.) ii. With respect to collateral, Lenders must use commercially reasonable and prudent practices to identify collateral, which conforms to procedures at least as thorough as those used for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Decisions regarding what collateral must be taken to secure a loan are based on the circumstances of the individual loan, including size, and must meet the minimum requirements set forth in this section.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_167_849482755", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

When loan proceeds from a Working Capital CAPLine loan will be used to refinance existing debt, the loan should be secured with at least the same collateral and lien priority as the debt that is being refinanced. When the debt being refinanced is considered as being over collateralized based upon SBA collateral requirements and the SBA loan will remain fully secured, the Lender is not required to take excess collateral. Substitute collateral may be offered providing it is of comparable value and useful life and is determined to be acceptable by SBA or the Lender when processing the line under its PLP authority. iv. Adequacy of Collateral: A loan request is not to be declined solely on the basis of inadequate collateral. In fact, one of the primary reasons Lenders use the SBA-guaranteed program is for those Applicants that demonstrate repayment ability but lack adequate collateral to repay the loan in full in the event of default. However, SBA does not permit its guaranty to be a substitute for available collateral. Working Capital CAPLines i. If the Lender will disburse the line based on a BBC, the Lender must obtain a first lien on the Applicant’s working/trading assets (i.e., accounts receivable, inventory). ii. If the Lender will not use a BBC to disburse the line: a) The Lender must assume full use of the revolving line of credit and secure the line with sufficient collateral to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio. Lender must obtain a first lien position on the working/trading assets (accounts receivable and inventory) financed with the line. If the working/trading assets are insufficient to provide a 1:1 collateral ratio, the Lender also must take additional collateral to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio. b) If business assets do not fully secure the loan, the Lender must take available equity in personal real estate (residential and investment property, including other commercial real estate) of any owners of 20% or more of the Applicant and guarantors, except Supplemental Guarantors, to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio. Liens on personal real estate may be limited to the amount of the collateral shortfall. In addition, liens on personal real estate may be limited to 150% of the equity in the collateral. SBA does not require a Lender to collateralize a loan with real estate (including commercial, residential and investment properties owned by the Applicant or personally by the owners) when the equity in the real estate is less than 25% of the property’s fair market value. See Paragraph D.3.d., Working Capital CAPLines, below for further guidance. Contract CAPLines i.

See Paragraph D.3.b.i.b), Exception to the Assignment of Contract Proceeds, in this Chapter below for guidance on exceptions to when an assignment is required. ii. The Lender may take additional collateral in accordance with its policies and procedures governing its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit. iii. All liens must be perfected and the lien position verified prior to the initial disbursement of the line. For seasonal, contract or builder lines that revolve for more than one season, contract or construction/renovation project, liens must be perfected prior to the initial disbursement for each season, contract, or project. Builders CAPLines i. SBA will accept no less than a second lien position on the property being constructed or renovated if the purpose of the first lien was to acquire the property. ii. If the property is part of a subdivision where the Lender for the subdivision holds a first lien OR serves as partial collateral for a loan secured by more than one parcel of real estate, the first lienholder must provide a “release clause” for transfer of clear title to any eventual buyer of individual parcels upon receipt of a pre-established payment. iii. Lenders must not take a second lien position if the first lienholder requires that the entire loan be paid in full before any property is released. Where Lender/SBA is in a second position, the total amount necessary to release the first and second liens may not exceed 80% of the fair market value (selling price) of the completed project. Real Estate Appraisal Requirements The regulation governing real estate appraisal is set forth at 13 CFR § 120.160(b). i. Commercial Real Estate: a) For all loans greater than $500,000 secured by commercial real property, all Lenders must obtain an appraisal by a State licensed or certified appraiser. Appraisals must be in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Additionally, SBA requires that completed appraisals be dated within 12 months of the application for guaranty. For federally-regulated Lenders, no exemption is granted under the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines dated December 2, 2010 for Trans actions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency. b) For all loans $500,000 or less secured by commercial real property: i) If the loan finances a transaction involving parties with a close relationship (for example, transactions between existing owners or family members), or if SBA or the Lender otherwise concludes that an", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_169_629929605", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Evaluations are not required to be performed in accordance with USPAP or by State licensed or certified appraisers but should be consistent with the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines and the Interagency Advisory on the Use of Evaluations in Real Estate-Related Financial Transactions, issued by the Federal Banking Regulators. c) The appraiser must be: i) Independent and have no appearance of a conflict of interest (such as a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the property or transaction, independent of the loan production function, and not involved in the approval of the transaction); and ii) Either State-licensed or State-certified, with the following exception: when the commercial property’s estimated value is over $1,000,000, the appraiser must be State-certified. d) In order for the appraiser to identify the scope of work appropriately, the appraisal must identify the Lender as the client and/or an intended user of the appraisal, as those terms are defined in USPAP, except that federally-regulated Lenders may follow their primary regulator’s FIRREA requirements to the extent they permit otherwise. The Lender may not use an appraisal prepared for the seller or the Applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Applicant. e) The appraisal must be an “Appraisal Report” prepared in compliance with USPAP. f) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.) After construction is completed, Lender must obtain a statement from the appraiser, general contractor, project architect, or construction management firm that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based. If the Lender cannot obtain such a statement, then the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission. g) If the SBA-guaranteed loan was used to cover the construction period, the Lender must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any deviation(s) and work with the SBA CLSC to determine an appropriate course of", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_170_117498134", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender’s notification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. If the Lender is unable to obtain a statement that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based, but is able to obtain a new appraisal demonstrating that the market value meets or exceeds the original estimate of value, then no additional action on the part of the Lender is necessary. h) If the loan will be used to acquire an existing building that does not require construction, the appraiser should estimate market value on an as-is basis. If the appraiser estimates the value other than on an as-is basis, the narrative must include an explanation of why the as-is basis was not used. i) When valuing the collateral, the Lender must not include the contributory value of any rental income or the value of any intangible assets contained in the appraisal. j) An appraisal may be submitted as part of the loan application to assist with the underwriting or as part of the loan closing. In no case may the Lender rely on an appraisal that was prepared more than 12 months prior to the date of the application. k) If the Lender is going to require the appraisal at closing, the loan application must include an estimate of the value of the real estate and the estimate must be identified in the Lender’s credit memorandum with the requirement for an appraisal that supports the estimated value at time of closing. l) If at time of closing the appraised value: i) Is 90% or more of the estimated value, the Lender may close the loan but must include a written explanation as to why the appraisal is less than the estimated value in the loan file; or ii) Is less than 90% of estimated value, the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission (see exception below for PLP Lenders).

The justification must include a thorough analysis by the Lender of the reasons for the appraisal being low and an explanation as to what steps the Lender took to offset the risk to SBA from the low appraisal such as additional equity or additional collateral. ii. Non-commercial real estate or real estate securing a personal guaranty: SBA has no specific appraisal requirements for non-commercial real estate (such as a residence) or real estate (commercial or non-commercial) taken as collateral to secure a personal guaranty. D. SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION FOR GUARANTY FOR ALL CAPLINES 1. Contents of Lender’s Application for Guaranty The contents of the Lender’s application for guaranty vary depending on the size of the loan and the method of processing chosen by the Lender. Based on the method of processing, the Lender may or may not be required to submit the documentation and exhibits to SBA, but in all cases must maintain those documents and any that support the guaranty request in their loan files. Lender must submit to E-Tran all terms and conditions required by E-Tran data fields. Lender must list in E-Tran all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant, and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant. SBA Form 1919 includes information on the number of existing employees at the time of application and the number of jobs to be created and/or retained as a result of the loan. • Number of existing employees at the time of application is calculated in accordance with 13 CFR § 121.106, which states in part that SBA counts all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis (i.e., jobs are not converted to full-time equivalents). • Jobs “created” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees that the small business expects to hire as a result of the loan. • Jobs “retained” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees on the payroll of the business at the time of application that will be lost if the loan is not approved. • “Employees” does not include contractors reported via IRS Form 1099.

Any application form obtained by the Lender from the applicant must be certified by the Applicant as true and complete. PLP Lenders processing loans under their PLP authority must obtain and retain the documentation listed below in their file. Additionally, Lender must submit the information required in SBA Form 1919 into E-Tran. For all loans submitted using the non-delegated process through the LGPC (including loans from PLP Lenders using this processing method), the Lender must submit applications for guaranty and all attachments via E-Tran to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan and any equity contribution to be required from the Applicant and will either approve or decline the loan in E- Tran. In addition, Lender must submit as part of the Application for guaranty those items below emphasized in bold. i. SBA Form 1919: A separate SBA Form 1919 for each co-borrower must be completed and signed by the authorized representative of the Applicant and submitted to the Lender. The aggregate amounts of the “Purpose of the loan” sections across all SBA Forms 1919 should equal the total amount of the loan request. Only the information required on SBA Form 1919, and not the form itself, must be submitted into E-Tran, although the Lender must obtain and retain the signed form in its file. ii. Lender’s Credit Memorandum must address all requirements detailed in paragraph C, Credit Standards in this chapter. iii. Owner Financial Statement (business or personal, as appropriate) dated within 120 days of submission to SBA, for all owners of 20% or more (including the assets of the owner’s spouse and minor children), and proposed guarantors, except Supplemental Guarantors . Lenders may use SBA Form 413 or their own equivalent form. If the Lender requires owner financial statements for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed loans, these statements must be submitted to LGPC as part of the application. If the Lender uses a credit score to evaluate the owner financials, then the Lender does not need to obtain owner financial statements. iv.

E-Tran terms and conditions–- CAPLines. i. Zero Balance Period Requirements: With the exception of Seasonal CAPLines, there is no requirement that a zero balance be maintained for any specific time period on any CAPLines. A “clean up” period may be included in the E-Tran terms and conditions at the Lender’s option. ii. See Chapter 5, E-Tran Terms and Conditions through Disbursement for all 7(a) Loans, in this Section below, for additional SBA requirements for the E- Tran terms and conditions. 2. Where to Submit Applications for Guaranty All 7(a) Lenders are permitted to submit applications for guaranty under non-delegated processing procedures. All CAPLines applications must be submitted through E-Tran. Non-delegated applications–- Lenders submitting applications using non- delegated procedures (including loans from PLP Lenders) must submit applications for guaranty and all attachments via E-Tran to the LGPC. Documents greater than 250MB must be separated into multiple documents. The system does not support uploads greater than 250MB. PLP applications – Lenders submitting applications using their PLP authority must submit guaranty applications via E-Tran, retaining all required documentation in the Lender’s loan file. Reconsideration of Declined CAPLine (non-delegated) Applications (13 CFR § 120.193): i. If the Lender believes the reason(s) for decline have been overcome, a request for reconsideration may be submitted along with a detailed written explanation of how the Applicant has overcome the reason(s) for decline. Lender must submit a request for reconsideration to the LGPC within 6 months of the date of decline. Any request submitted more than 120 days after the date of decline must include current financial statements.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_175_406837693", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If a request for reconsideration is declined by the LGPC, a second appeal may be requested from the D/FA or designee, whose decision is final. The appeal to the D/FA or designee must be submitted to the LGPC and must include a copy of the Center’s decline letter and include additional information that specifically addresses the reason(s) identified for decline and how the Applicant has overcome those reason(s). The LGPC will forward the request to the D/FA or designee for a final decision.

CAPLines-Specific Loan Closing and Disbursement Requirements See Chapter 5, Para. D of this Section below for additional requirements for loan closing and disbursement. Seasonal CAPLines: i. Disbursement and Repayment: a) Disbursements from the loan are made continually during the seasonal build-up period when the cash requirement for labor, materials, and support of accounts receivables exceeds actual cash receipts. The final disbursement of any Seasonal loan should be made in time for the funds to be used in the business and converted to cash which can be used to pay off the loan balance at the commencement of a 30 day clean up period or maturity. b) Principal repayments on the loan must occur as soon as the cash from the seasonal sales has been received by the Borrower. Interest should be paid monthly. ii. Borrowing Base Certificate (BBC): Lender may use BBCs to monitor the Borrower’s seasonal activity. If the Lender does so, the BBC must be submitted by the Borrower to the Lender no less frequently than monthly. Contract CAPLines: i. Assignment of Contract Proceeds: a) Subject to the exception noted in b) below, prior to initial disbursement on any Contract CAPLine, the entity the Borrower has entered into the contract with must be advised in writing by both the Lender and Borrower that an assignment of the contract proceeds is required. Such assignment must be in place before any disbursement for a particular contract is made and include a provision for the Lender’s right to receive all payments from the third party. The Lender must receive written acknowledgement from the third party.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_176_237376883", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

(The definition of a “successful track record” includes but is not limited to, any prior contractual arrangement between the subject parties, where the responsibilities of each party under the contract were met to the satisfaction of all parties to the contract.); iii) Financial analysis of historical income statements and/or tax returns and pro-forma financial statements show that the applicant has a Debt Service Coverage ratio that exceeds 1:1; iv) All contract proceeds are paid directly to the lender by the contracting authority or, in the instance where a performance bond is in place, a Funds Control (or escrow or third party servicer) procedure is implemented; or v) There is other available and worthwhile collateral pledged to secure the line by either the Borrower or any owner/guarantor, except Supplemental Guarantors . ii. Prime and Subcontractor Contracts: Subject to subparagraph 3.b.i., Assignment of Contract Proceeds, above, a contract between a Prime and Subcontractor is eligible to be financed with a Contract CAPLine, if at least two of the following conditions are met: a) Both the Prime and the Subcontractor have favorable credit ratings based on an acceptable rating agency (e.g., Builders Industry Credit Association “BICA”); b) There is a successful track record between the Prime contractor and the Subcontractor (Borrower); c) There is a successful track record between the Prime contractor and the contracting authority; d) The Contract CAPLine amount is less than $300,000; e) The term of the contract is 12 months or less; f) The financial analysis of historical income statements and/or tax returns and pro-forma financial statements show that the applicant has a Debt Service Coverage ratio that exceeds 1:1; or g) There is other available and worthwhile collateral pledged by either the Borrower or any owner/guarantor, except Supplemental Guarantors . iii.

SBA recognizes the following conditions may be necessary to effectuate the transaction where a contract requires a Surety’s performance bond: a) The Lender’s perfected UCC security interest in the contract proceeds will be subordinate to the cost reimbursement claim of the Surety; and b) The Surety may require that a funds control facility be executed. The funds control facility would disburse directly to suppliers and laborers. The contracting authority will remit contract proceeds directly to the funds control facility, which will remit payment to the lender. iv. Purchase Orders under a Master Agreement: Purchase Orders (PO) may be substituted for a formal contract, provided the following conditions exist: a) The PO is issued to the Borrower under a Master Agreement; and b) The combination of the PO and the Master Agreement constitute a binding agreement. v. Disbursements are made, when needed, to pay for the costs on a specific contract. Disbursements will generally be made as the contract progresses, not with one lump sum disbursement to cover all costs. Only if the contract performance period was 30 days or less should only one disbursement for payroll be allowed. However, if a borrowing contractor wanted to acquire all of their materials up front to take advantage of volume discounts, and/or pay for all acquired materials within 10 days to take advantage of prompt pay discounts, the Contract CAPLine Program will accommodate such a disbursement plan. vi. With the assignment of contract proceeds and direct payment in place, the Lender receives all the payments the Borrower would normally receive if it was internally financing the contract as performance progresses. Because all performance costs (including direct overhead and allocated general/administrative expenses) were funded under the CAPLine, all such payments received by the Lender must be applied first to interest due on the CAPLine, with the remainder applied to the CAPLine balance until the balance is paid in full. vii. If deemed necessary from a credit standpoint by the Lender, the Lender may invoke additional controls over the payments, provided the Lender obtains the Borrower’s prior written consent. If such additional controls include the funding of direct material and labor only, as opposed to all contract costs, then the Lender must inform the Borrower in writing of the percentage split arrangement regarding the allocation of progress payments received from the contracting authority.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_178_838170828", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Amount of disbursement shall not exceed 100% of labor, material, and other eligible costs of construction certified to be complete and shall be supported by contractor’s statements and lien waivers to date. ii. Prior to final disbursement of construction funds, final lien waivers must be obtained from Borrower/contractor and all subcontractors, material men, and any independent workers involved in the construction. No disbursement can be made after maturity of the master note. iii. The repayment of all funds disbursed for any individual project shall occur within 36 months after completion of each individual project or at the time of sale, whichever is less. A single principal payment is acceptable. Interest payments must be made at least semi-annually and from the applicant’s own resources, not from loan proceeds. Working Capital CAPLines: i. For Working Capital CAPLines, Lenders have the option of disbursing the line proceeds based on a BBC, or 1:1 collateral ratio. a) If a Lender will not use a BBC to determine the availability of funds for disbursement, the Lender must: i) Use a combination of factors for the underwriting and credit decision consistent with its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit, including at a minimum; (a) Cash flow analysis to determine the adequacy, duration, and dependability of cash flow; (b) Collateral analysis to establish an estimated value of collateral; and (c) Owner/Guarantor analysis, except Supplemental Guarantors ; ii) Assume full utilization of the revolving line of credit and secure the line with sufficient collateral to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio. Lender must obtain a first lien position on the working/trading assets (accounts receivable and inventory) financed with the line. If the working/trading assets are insufficient to provide a 1:1 collateral ratio, the Lender also must take additional collateral to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio. If business assets do not fully secure the line, the Lender must take available personal equity in personal real estate of the principals as collateral to ensure there is a 1:1 collateral ratio; (a) To determine if there is a 1:1 collateral ratio, discount the available collateral based upon the Net Book Value presented on the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_179_677459271", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Machinery and equipment may be valued at 50% of Net Book Value or 80% with an Orderly Liquidation Value minus any prior liens. Real estate can be supported at 85% of the value; (b) If the line will be secured by fixed assets and the valuation of fixed assets is greater than their Net Book Value , an independent appraisal by a qualified individual must be obtained by the lender to support the higher valuation. The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest; iii) Obtain Borrower prepared financial statements and tax returns if the CAPLine amount is $1,000,000 or less and compiled, reviewed, or audited financial statements and tax returns if the CAPLine amount is over $1,000,000, consistent with lender’s policies governing its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit; iv) Use financial covenants consistent with those used on Lender’s similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit.

The following types of accounts are not eligible to be included in the borrowing base: (a) Any invoice more than 90 days past due. Exceptions are permitted over the 90 day with SBA’s prior written concurrence. To avoid unnecessary disqualification of receivables, the Borrower may structure their receivables terms so that the due date properly reflects the cash conversion cycle (timely payment) of the customer. (b) If a customer is delinquent on more than 50% of its total outstanding invoices, ALL of the accounts due from that customer are ineligible. To re-establish the customer’s accounts as eligible, all delinquent accounts must be paid in full. Exceptions are permitted if the Lender obtains SBA’s prior written concurrence. (c) All re-billed accounts. (Re-billing is the practice of issuing a credit to a customer and re-invoicing the obligation in the current billing cycle.

(e) Offsetting receivables and payables between the Borrower and one of its creditors (contra accounts). (f) Accounts due from affiliate companies. (g) Accounts that require subordination to other parties, such as Governmental contracts where the bonding company requires assignment of the project’s receivables. (b) When advancing against inventory, a Lender should: Obtain a description of inventory and its value; and Limit advances to the following types of inventory: (a) Finished Goods: Eligible if readily saleable and not obsolete. (b) Work in Progress: Eligible if Lender obtains SBA’s prior written concurrence. (c) Commodities or Raw Materials: Eligible. (c) The dollar amount of ineligible receivables and inventory will remain unchanged for the entire month. The actual borrowing availability may increase or decrease as the balance on the line changes and the receivables and inventory are generated or converted back to cash. (d) A BBC is required at least monthly to determine the amount that can be disbursed. Lender may require a BBC more frequently consistent with its policy and procedures on similarly-sized non- SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit. Lenders may use their own forms for the BBC. A sample BBC is provided in Appendix 9 . iii) Repayments will come from cash sales and receivable collections. Proceeds must pay down the line as collected with availability to re- advance as long as the Borrower is conforming to the maximum amount of the BBC. iv) If a cash collateral account is being used and a balance remains in the cash collateral account after the loan has been paid down to zero, those funds may be credited to Borrower’s operating account. There is no provision for interest only payments. Interest must be paid at least monthly either from Borrower’s own resources OR from loan proceeds at the time of an advance.

The maximum advance rate may go up to 90% of the eligible receivables if the receivable is a prime Federal contract and the Lender has obtained an assignment of the contract proceeds under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (the Act), 31 USC 3727, or the Borrower is a subcontractor and the prime contractor has obtained an assignment under the Act and the contract proceeds will be disbursed by a third party funds control facility or the foreign accounts receivable are insured by the Export-Import Bank or a major private insurer. Additional exceptions may be permitted if the lender obtains SBA’s prior written concurrence. The advance rate should not include any net profit. Factors that should be taken into consideration when determining the maximum advance rate are: Control and accounting systems of the Borrower; Enhancements such as credit insurance; Age of receivables; Credit quality & Borrower’s credit policy; Turnover history; Industry orientation and condition; and Net profit margin.

Increases or decreases in the advance rate above 5% require SBA’s prior written concurrence. viii) Examinations: If the Working Capital CAPLine is over $1,000,000, Lender must conduct an annual field examination. The field examination may be conducted by the Lender’s staff or a third party. An examination is a physical verification of the assets which compose the borrowing base. Examinations must include a sampling of the assets (receivables and inventory) included in the borrowing base. The frequency of the examinations may be determined by the Lender based upon the quality of the records, risk profile of the Borrower and seasonality of the line. At a minimum, an examination must be conducted prior to the initial disbursement and annually thereafter. The Lender must describe the level and frequency of examinations in the credit memorandum for the line. ix) Monitoring: The minimum monitoring requirements for Working Capital CAPLines are as follows: (a) Monthly–- BBC; Aging of accounts receivable/payable; and Inventory listing (if advanced against); (b) Quarterly – Borrower prepared financial statements; and (c) Annually – Borrowers management information system; legal elements; loan agreements; NAICS review; review of cash flow and related financials: and reassess exam, monitoring and control requirements.

If, however, the account does not meet one of the five conditions, then the Lender must obtain SBA’s prior written consent in order to include the account in the eligible borrowing base. Such requests must be sent to the LGPC. ii. Level of Funds Control: The level of funds control for a Working Capital CAPLine, whether a BBC is used or not, is determined by the banking relationship the lender has with the Borrower. a) If the Lender has the Borrower’s deposit accounts, the Lender is not required to use cash collateral accounts or other types of controlled accounts but must follow its established procedures for its similarly- sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit to monitor payments received. b) If the Lender does not have the Borrower’s deposit accounts, then the Lender must use some form of controlled account as follows: i) The customers of the Borrower can be instructed to send their remittances via joint payee checks payable to lender and Borrower to the Lender; or ii) Lock box (bank account under Lender control where Borrower’s customers remit payments for accounts receivable). iii.

Disbursements after the last cash cycle has begun, but before maturity, require SBA’s prior written approval. However, if maturity coincides with the scheduled annual review of the line, including an annual review conducted by Lender coincidental with the maturity of the line, Lender may advance on the line up to maturity in conjunction with the Lender’s annual review in accordance with Lender’s policies and procedures on its similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial lines of credit. No advances can be made after maturity. When a balance exists on a CAPLine at maturity, the lender should consider the following: a) Enforce final collection; b) Renew the line without SBA’s guaranty; c) Renew the line, requesting SBA’s guaranty (new application required if maturity has reached 10 years); d) Term out any outstanding balance, with SBA’s concurrence.

EXPORT EXPRESS The Export Express Loan Program guarantees smaller dollar revolving lines of credit or term loans to support small business concerns that wish to develop the export side of their business. It offers many of the streamlined features of SBA Express while providing a higher guarantee to mitigate international credit risk. Lenders must always start by reviewing the contents of Section A, Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans. 1. Eligibility and Eligible Uses of Proceeds for Export Express In addition to the core requirements identified in Section A, eligibility for Export Express is limited to businesses that have been in operation, although not necessarily as Exporters , for at least 12 full months. However, Applicants that have been in operation for less than 12 months are eligible if both of the following conditions are met: • The Applicant’s key personnel have clearly demonstrated Export Transaction expertise and substantial previous successful business experience; and • The Lender processes the Export Express loan using conventional commercial loan underwriting procedures and does not rely solely on credit scoring or credit matrices to approve the loan. Non-bank Lenders that do not have a conventional loan portfolio must submit their underwriting procedures to the Office of Credit Risk Management for written approval prior to making an Export Express loan. Evidence of compliance with both of these requirements must be retained by the Lender in its file. Export Express loans must be used for an export development activity, which includes the following: i. Obtaining a Standby Letter of Credit when required as a bid bond, performance bond, or advance payment guarantee; ii. Participation in a trade show that takes place outside the United States; iii. Translation of product brochures or catalogues for use in markets outside the United States; iv. Obtaining a general line of credit for Export Transaction purposes (as a normal course of business, the Borrower may use portions of the line of credit for domestic purposes, as long as no less than 70% of the line of credit will be used for export purposes); v. Performing a service contract from buyers located outside the United States; vi. Obtaining transaction-specific financing associated with completing Export Transaction orders; vii. Purchasing real estate or equipment to be used in the production of goods or services for Export Transactions;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_189_616893315", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Acquiring, constructing, renovating, modernizing, improving, or expanding a production facility or equipment to be used in the United States in the production of goods or services for Export Transactions; ix. Providing term loans and other financing to enable a small business concern, including an export trading company and an export management company, to develop a market outside the United States; x. Refinancing debt as outlined in paragraph b. immediately below; and xi. Financing indirect exports. The term “indirect export” applies to situations where, although the Borrower’s direct customer is located in the United States, that customer will be exporting the items/services it purchased from the Borrower to a foreign Buyer. In such cases, the Borrower must provide documentation to the Lender from the Borrower’s domestic customer (typically in the form of a letter, invoice, order, or contract) that the goods or services are in fact being exported. xii. Change of ownership only under conditions outlined in paragraph c. below. Debt Refinancing: SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds may not be used to pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss (including the same institution’s debt). This includes refinancing debt that will shift all or part of a potential loss from the original Lender to the SBA. 13 CFR §§ 120.140(j)(1) and 120.201 i. A Lender may refinance debt under Export Express as follows: a) A Lender may refinance an existing non-SBA guaranteed loan or Borrower debt from another lender if: i) The Lender determines the existing debt no longer meets the needs of the Applicant (for example, if the current loan is a term loan and a revolver is needed); ii) The new payment amount must be at least 10 percent less than the existing payment amount(s) in the aggregate, which may include a balloon payment due within 18 months. If the note term of the debt being refinanced includes an escalating payment structure, the new installment amount must be at least 10 percent less than the expected installment amount within the next 12 months. If other debt is being refinanced at the same time, such debt may be included in the cash flow improvement calculation. Refinancing revolving debt is not subject to the 10 percent payment improvement requirement; and iii) The Lender obtains documentation to verify that the new loan or line of credit will be used for export development activities. b) A Lender may refinance its own non-SBA guaranteed debt to the Applicant if: i) The conditions in paragraph a) above are met;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_190_333928702", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

A loan that has matured and not been paid within 29 days of the maturity date is not current and is not eligible for refinancing; and iii) The Lender’s exposure to the Applicant will not be reduced. c) An Export Express Lender may refinance its own or another Lender’s existing Export Express or 7(a) guaranteed loan with a new Export Express loan provided that the loan meets Export Express requirements and: i) The conditions in paragraph a) above are met; and ii) The Applicant needs additional financing and the existing Lender is unable to increase the existing SBA loan or make a second loan. d) Lenders must avoid any circumstances that could create a possible conflict of interest. Also, in refinancing debt, particularly credit card debt, Lenders must take reasonable steps to ensure Applicants are aware and certify that refinancing comprises only business-related debt. (SBA Form 1919, Borrower’s Information Form, includes such a certification.) ii. A 7(a) loan may not be used to refinance a debt owed to a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) or a New Markets Venture Capital Company 13 CFR § 120.130(b) . iii. The payment of trade payables is not considered to be debt refinancing. Change of Ownership (13 CFR § 120.202). i. An Applicant may use Export Express loan proceeds for a change of ownership, whether the change of ownership is accomplished through a stock purchase or an asset purchase, only under the circumstances described in this paragraph. An asset purchase will be deemed a change of ownership and must comply with all of the requirements of this paragraph if the Applicant is purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of the seller’s business. The following requirements apply: a) The Applicant must purchase 100% of the ownership interest in another small business or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another small business through an asset purchase. b) Regardless of whether the change of ownership is a stock purchase or an asset purchase, the Applicant must acquire from the seller real estate, a production facility or equipment to be used in the United States in the production of goods or services for export. i) The Applicant must be eligible under Para. A.1.a. of this Chapter. ii) Either the Applicant or the business being acquired (i.e., the seller) must be currently engaged in exporting.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_191_447160621", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The following changes of ownership are not eligible for financing as an Export Express loan: a) A change of ownership between existing owners of the Applicant. b) A change of ownership where the Applicant is purchasing less than 100% of the ownership of a business. iii. The maximum 7(a) loan uses of proceeds for any change of ownership is capped at the business valuation amount. When the business valuation is lower than the sales agreement, any financed capital required to meet the shortfall (in addition to the 7(a) loan and any equity injection) must be subordinate to the 7(a) loan. iv. Seller earnouts/buyer rebates: Seller earnouts are prohibited; however, buyer rebates based on business performance are allowed because this is a benefit to the Borrower. If the Borrower receives funds based on the rebate, it should first be applied to pay down the 7(a) loan to a point that will not trigger a subsidy recoupment fee, and any remaining funds may be used for business purposes; v. The seller may not remain as an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of the Applicant. If a short transitional period is needed, the small business may contract with the seller as a consultant for a period not to exceed 12 months including any extensions. vi. The Applicant may be the Borrower, or the Applicant and the small business being acquired may be Co-Borrowers. vii. The Lender must comply with the requirements for IRS verification identified in Section A, Ch. 5, Para. B, IRS Tax Transcript/Verification of Financial Information. viii. The Lender’s loan documentation must include: a) A current business valuation (not to include any real estate) that meets SBA requirements in paragraph 4.d., Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements, of this Chapter. b) A site visit of the business being acquired. The Lender must document in its loan file the date of the site visit as well as comments. c) An analysis of the following: i) The Applicant meets Export Express Loan Program Requirements under Para. A.1.of this Chapter; ii) Whether the Applicant or business being acquired (i.e., the seller) is currently engaged in exporting;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_192_332155101", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The “purchase price of the business” includes all assets being acquired, such as real estate, machinery and equipment, and intangible assets. x. Intangible Assets: An Export Express loan may be used to finance a change of ownership that includes intangible assets (including, but not limited to, goodwill, client/customer lists, patents, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property, and agreements not to compete) as long as it is supported by an independent business valuation that complies with paragraph 4.d., Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements, of this Chapter. a) If any of the loan proceeds will be used to finance intangible assets, the amount must be specifically identified in the Use of Proceeds section of the application and E-Tran. b) The value of the intangible assets is determined by either the book value as reflected on the business’s balance sheet, a separate appraisal for the particular asset, or the value of the business as identified in a business valuation that complies with paragraph 4.d., Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements below minus the sum of the working capital assets and fixed assets being purchased. c) While a change of ownership financed by an Export Express loan may include the acquisition of intangible assets, the change of ownership must also include the acquisition of real estate, a production facility or equipment to be used in the United States in the production of goods or services for export. Loan proceeds may not be used to: i. Finance operations outside of the United States, except for the marketing and/or distribution of products/services exported from the United States; or ii. Refinance existing SBA-guaranteed loans except as permitted under Paragraph b.i.c) above. When an Export Express loan finances specific export transactions (including indirect exports) under paragraph 1.a.i, v, or vi above, the Lender must determine if U.S. companies are authorized to conduct business with the Parties and the country(ies) to which the goods or services will be shipped. Lenders must check Ex-Im Bank’s Country Limitation Schedule, which can be found on Ex-Im Bank’s website at www.exim.gov/tools-for-exporters/country-limitation-schedule", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_193_350530281", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender also must check the Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists, which can be found at sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/ . i. For federally-regulated Lenders, compliance with the procedures required by the Lender’s Federal Financial Institution Regulator will constitute compliance with the above referenced OFAC requirement. ii. For SBA Supervised Lenders, Lender must check the OFAC sanctions lists prior to first disbursement of funds on each specific export transaction. A loan may not be made to a business that directly or indirectly exports to a foreign country which is listed as a prohibited country (Note # 7 on the Country Limitation Schedule), or if the transaction would be prohibited under any of the sanctions programs administered by OFAC. Documentation required: SBA requires the Lender to obtain information from the Borrower pertaining to the use of proceeds and its projected impact on the Borrower’s export sales and retain that documentation in its loan file. The Applicant must provide documentation regarding the following items (this may be in the form of a general business plan, an attachment to the loan application or on a Lender-developed questionnaire): i. Estimated total export sales the loan will support; ii. A brief description of the business’ product or service which will be exported; iii. An explanation of how the loan proceeds will enable the business to enter a new export market or expand in an existing export market; iv. The countries to which the business will export; and v. An estimate of the Borrower’s export sales for the 12 month period following the date of the loan application. 2. Other Restrictions that apply to Export Express Loans For purposes of clarification, small businesses in the following NAICS Industry Subsector Codes cannot be financed using an Export Express Loan, but may be financed using other SBA 7(a) financial assistance: i. NAICS Industry Subsector Code 721 (Accommodation) ii. NAICS Industry Subsector Code 457 (Gasoline Stations). The following types of loans are not eligible under Export Express processing: i. Loans to a cooperative or to an eligible small business owned or controlled by a cooperative (see Section A, Ch. 2, Para. B.3., Cooperatives , for more information); ii. Loans involving a Single Employer 401(k) plan, including a ROBS plan, unless the only investment held by the 401(k) plan at the time of application is the equity in the Applicant business; and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_194_614610909", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

B.4., 401(k) Plans Including Rollovers as Business Start-Ups (ROBS) Plans, for more information). 3. Loan Terms and Conditions for Export Express a. Maximum Loan Amount i. The maximum loan amount is $500,000 (gross). ii. Maximum Loans to Businesses with Affiliates 13 CFR § 120.151 Lenders must determine whether the Applicant has any affiliates and document the results in their credit analysis. If affiliation exists, SBA’s loan maximums apply to the Applicant, including all affiliates, as if all were a single business. b. Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages The maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business (including affiliates) must not exceed $3,750,000. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount for a revolving line of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.” i. Multiple Export Express loans are allowed up to the program maximum loan amount ($500,000 gross for Export Express). The guaranteed amount of all Export Express loans counts toward the $3,750,000 maximum SBA exposure that may be outstanding for all SBA loans to a Borrower and its affiliates at any one time. ii. If multiple Export Express loans are approved within 90 days of each other, and the combined gross loan amount of all the Export Express loans approved in that time frame to any one Borrower (including affiliates) exceeds $350,000, then the maximum guaranty percentage on the second loan must be reduced accordingly so the combined guaranty is no more than 75% (subject to the $3,750,000 guaranty amount limit). iii. The maximum guaranty percentage is: a) 90% for loans of $350,000 or less; and b) 75% for loans over $350,000 up to $500,000. iv. Combination of 7(a) and 504 loans a) When an Applicant applies for any combination of 7(a) and 504 loans, the order in which the loans are approved determines the maximum loan and guaranty amount available. Because the 7(a) loan has a lower maximum guaranteed amount, the 7(a) loan should be processed and approved first.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_195_489796623", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Zero Percent Guaranty Cannot be Provided for Ineligible Purposes: A 7(a) loan cannot include proceeds for an ineligible purpose or have any portion of the loan made to an ineligible business and no part of an SBA 7(a) loan may be guaranteed at zero percent. c. Loan Maturities i. Export Express loans must have a stated maturity. The loan term must be the shortest appropriate term based on the use of proceeds and the Borrower's ability to repay. a) Lines of credit must not exceed 7 years. i) Transactional lines of credit: No disbursement can be made for an export transaction where payment by the foreign buyer will occur after the maturity date of the loan. ii) Revolving loans: (a) Maximum maturity includes any “term-out” period; (b) May be established as renewable each year provided they do not exceed the maximum maturity. (c) Lender may not charge a renewal fee. If the original maturity was for 12 months or less, and the new maturity exceeds 12 months, an additional guaranty fee will be due. b) Export Express Term Loans: (13 CFR § 120.212 ): A loan’s term must be: i) The shortest appropriate term, depending upon the Borrower's ability to repay; ii) Working capital or inventory loans and the financing of intangible assets (including goodwill) must not exceed 10 years. iii) Generally, equipment, fixtures, or furniture loans should not exceed 10 years. However, the term may be up to 15 years if the IRS asset class useful life supports the term. The term for a loan to finance equipment and/or leasehold improvements may include an additional reasonable period, not to exceed 12 months, when necessary to complete the installation of the equipment and/or complete the leasehold improvements. iv) Real estate loans (including acquisition, rehabilitation, renovation, construction, or improvements to leasehold interests in land) must not", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_196_840941163", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

If the use of proceeds on a real estate loan includes construction or renovation, an additional period reasonably necessary for the construction or renovation period may be added to the 25-year maximum maturity. v) Loans for leasehold improvements (except for leasehold interests in land) may not exceed 10 years, plus an additional period reasonably necessary to complete the leasehold improvements, as determined based on the specific nature of the leasehold improvements, but in no case more than 12 months. vi) Mixed purpose loans: When loan proceeds are used for multiple purposes (land and building, working capital, machinery & equipment, or the refinancing of any of these purposes), the maturity may be a blended maturity or, if 51% or more of the use of proceeds are for real estate, the maximum maturity may be up to 25 years. vii) Loan maturity for complete change of ownership: Only when the purchase price includes the commercial real estate from which the Applicant business operates (i.e., is not investment or personal real estate) and when the value of the commercial real estate is 51% or more of the purchase price, the loan may have a maximum maturity of 25 years. Otherwise, the maximum maturity is 10 years. ii. Export Express Non-Financial Default Provisions: Non-financial default provisions are allowed under Export Express under the following conditions: i) Non-financial default provisions are loan conditions that, if violated, would cause the loan to be in default even though the Borrower has made all payments as agreed. ii) Non-financial default provisions must be substantive and must be agreed to by the Borrower in writing at loan closing; iii) The provisions must be consistent with those used by the Lender on its similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans; iv) A lender may not request purchase of the guaranty solely based on a violation of a non-financial default provision (see 13 CFR § 120.520 ); and v) A maturity date must be established in the note. For example, a line of credit could state that it is payable upon demand under certain conditions, but in no case later than a certain date. d.

General Policy on Interest Rates (13 CFR §§ 120.213 & 120.214): a) A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The maximum interest rate that may be established for any 7(a) loan is governed by SBA’s regulations on interest rates, which preempts any provisions of a state’s constitution or law. The Lender negotiates the interest rate with the Applicant, subject to SBA’s maximum allowable rates. b) SBA will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the Federal Register. The maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be the Prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month, plus an allowable spread over Prime, as set forth in the most recent Federal Register Notice . For a listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates, go to SBA’s FTA Wiki. The maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by a Lender if such rate will be in effect for the entire term of the loan, without adjustment or reset. Otherwise, the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply. c) For variable interest rate loans, the basis for the SBA maximum allowable interest rate is an acceptable base rate plus allowable spread. The base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by SBA during that month. (Note: The date the “complete loan application is received by SBA” is the date the loan is approved and assigned an SBA loan number.) The initial note rate must not exceed SBA’s maximum interest rate. The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. d) For loans with a variable interest rate, the following terms must be defined in E-Tran and the Note: i) Base Rate and spread: (a) There are two acceptable base rates: The Prime Rate; or", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_198_349960388", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

This rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month. If a website is used, please ensure whether it is publishing the current day’s rate or the previous day’s rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day’s rate. The Optional Peg Rate is a weighted average of rates the Federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average 7(a) loan. SBA calculates and publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register. Base Rates will be rounded to two decimal places with .004 being rounded down to .00 and .005 being rounded up to .01. (c) For variable rate Export Express loans, the Lender is not required to use the base rate identified above in this paragraph and in 13 CFR § 120.214(c). The Lender may use the same base rate of interest it uses on its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, as well as its established change intervals, payment accruals, etc. However, the interest rate throughout the term of the loan may not exceed the maximum allowable Export Express interest rate and the loan may be sold on the Secondary Market only if the base rate is one of the base rates allowed in 13 CFR § 120.214(c). ii) Frequency of change; iii) Range of fluctuation; and iv) Ceiling and floor (if any). e) Default Interest Rates: The default interest rate is a change (increase) in the interest rate charged to the Borrower as a result of a failure to meet certain conditions specified in the loan agreement. i) A Lender may charge a default interest rate if it does so for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, as long as the interest rate does not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted for Export Express loans. ii) The amount of interest SBA will pay to a Lender following default of an Export Express loan is capped at the maximum interest rates for the Standard 7(a) loan program. ii.

The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (if prior to disbursement, Borrower’s consent to the change in interest rate must be separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed. The Borrower has asked the Lender if the loan can be switched to a fixed rate. If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan application, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. For further guidance see SOP 50 57 . c) Frequency of Interest Rate Adjustment: i) Export Express Lenders are permitted to use the same change intervals used on their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Export Express Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period. For example, Lenders have used periods as long as 5 years in order to provide the Borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first 5 years of the loan. After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. ii) The Lender must specify in the Note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur. (a) This adjustment period as identified in the Note may not be changed without the written consent of the Borrower. (b) All subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period. (c) The rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period. For example, if the first of the month is a Sunday, the base rate is the prime rate in effect on Monday. This rate will be reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, the third calendar day and second business", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_200_554597796", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period, especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the Secondary Market. d) Interest Rate Requirements for an SBA Note: i) For fixed rate loans, the Lender must state the specific interest rate in the Note. ii) For variable rate loans, the Lender must include the following information in the Note: (a) Identification of the rate being used as the base rate; (b) The publication in which the designated base rate appears regularly (e.g., Wall Street Journal or the Federal Register if using the SBA Optional Peg Rate); (c) The percentage spread, including any changes to percentage spread if applicable, to be added to the base rate (e.g., in a construction loan); (d) The initial interest rate of the loan (from disbursement to first adjustment); (e) The date or timing of the first rate adjustment; and (f) The frequency of rate adjustment. e) Interest Rate Ceilings and Floors: SBA will permit a Lender to limit the upward and downward adjustments by establishing a floor and ceiling provided that both the floor and ceiling are stated in the Note. f) Accrual Method: SBA does not require a specific accrual method, unless the loan is sold in the Secondary Market. Loans sold on the Secondary Market must either use 30/360 or Actual/365 as the interest accrual methods. iii. Amortization: (13 CFR § 120.214(e) ): Lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan. SBA does not allow balloon payments. A fixed interest rate loan must use a payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. Typically, variable rate loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. The amortization schedule may also be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business. iv. Fixed and Variable Rate Combinations: The Lender may use a fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and a variable rate on the other portion of the loan. SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_201_28802523", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. v. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: a) An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties where one party pays a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount. The contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan. The swap contract only relates to the payment of interest. Example: A Borrower has a prime plus 2% interest rate on a 7(a) variable rate guaranteed loan. The Borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at 8%. When the Note rate is lower than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract (8%), the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk that rates will at some point exceed 8%. When the Note rate is higher than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract, the Borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of 8% and the swap seller would pay the difference above 8% to the Lender. The ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the Borrower of an interest rate swap contract. b) In order to use an interest rate swap in the 7(a) program, the interest rate swap contract must meet the following conditions: i) The interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business Borrower and the Lender or, if the swap seller is not the lender, a third party. SBA is not a party to the interest rate swap contract. ii) The interest rate swap contract does not affect the amount of money owed by the Borrower to SBA in the event SBA purchases the guaranty. In the event of a Borrower default, interest will be calculated using the base rate and spread in the variable interest rate Note, not the swap contract. iii) SBA will not be responsible if the swap seller defaults during the life of the contract. The Borrower will be liable for the interest as required in the Note. iv) Loans with accompanying interest rate swap contracts may be sold on the Secondary Market. The Lender is still required under the Secondary Market contract (SBA Form 1086) to forward interest and principal pursuant to the original terms of the loan. It is the Lender’s responsibility to work with the swap seller to make sure funds are available for submission to the fiscal and transfer agent according to the time schedule in the Form 1086.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_202_871587594", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

While swap contracts should not have a significant impact on the cost of the loan, SBA will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts. vii) The Borrower must sign a statement acknowledging that interest will be calculated at the Note rate if the swap contract is terminated. viii) The following statement must be included in the swap contract that is executed by the Borrower and the swap seller: “The Small Business Administration is not a party to this contract and does not guarantee it. In the event SBA is called upon to honor its guaranty to the Lender, the Borrower’s debt will be determined by the terms of the Note, including the variable interest rate provision.” ix) Swap contracts may be used on new or existing loans. x) The swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the loan agreement. xi) SBA does not have a standard form for an interest rate swap contract. xii) Any fees owed the swap counterparty as a result of the default by the Borrower will be subordinated to the SBA 7(a) loan. 4. Credit Standards for Export Express The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150 . This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA. A Lender must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment, not any expected recovery from the liquidation of collateral. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. To the maximum extent practicable, Export Express Lenders may use their own forms, internal credit memoranda, notes, collateral documents, and servicing and liquidation documentation. In using their documents and procedures, Lenders must follow their established and proven internal procedures used for their similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. a. Processing Method Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened- out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its Export Express authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s Export Express authority for a period of", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_203_406836238", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Export Express loans are only processed via an Export Express Lender’s delegated authority. When a Lender submits an SBA 7(a) loan guaranty request under the Lender’s Export Express authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The Export Express Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy, when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. b. Underwriting i. SBA has authorized Export Express Lenders to make the credit decision without prior SBA review. Lenders must not make an Export Express loan that would be available on reasonable commercial terms from either the Lender itself or another source without an SBA guaranty. ii. The credit analysis must demonstrate there is a reasonable assurance of repayment. iii. The credit analysis must include the factors demonstrating the Applicant does not have credit available elsewhere on reasonable commercial terms from non-Federal, non-State, non-local government sources, in accordance with Section A, Ch. 2, Para. A, Credit not available elsewhere ; iv. The Lender must use appropriate, prudent, and generally accepted industry credit analysis processes and procedures (which may include credit scoring) and these procedures must be consistent with those used for the Lender’s similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. v. In addition to using the Lender’s appropriate, prudent and generally accepted industry credit analysis and procedures, Export Express Lenders may use a business credit scoring model (such a model cannot rely solely on consumer credit scores) to assess character, reputation, and credit history of the applicant and/or repayment ability if they do so for their similarly-sized, non- SBA guaranteed commercial loans. a) The business credit scoring model may only be used in addition to the Lender’s appropriate, prudent, and generally accepted industry credit analysis and procedures. b) If used, the business credit scoring results must be documented in each loan file and available for SBA review. c) Lenders must validate (and document) with appropriate and accepted statistical methodologies that their business credit scoring model is predictive of loan performance and they must provide that documentation to SBA upon request.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_204_396828598", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

SBLCs are required to provide credit scoring model validation to SBA on an annual basis. vi. The credit decision on Export Express loans, including how much to factor in a past bankruptcy or whether to require an equity injection, is left to the business judgment of the Lender. Also, if the Lender requires an equity injection and, as part of its standard processes for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed loans verifies the equity injection, it must do so for Export Express loans. While the credit decision is left to the business judgment of the Lender, early loan defaults will be reviewed by SBA pursuant to SOP 50 57 . c. Collateral See Section A, Ch. 5, Para. A. for guaranty requirements. i. With respect to collateral, Lenders must use commercially reasonable and prudent practices to identify collateral, which conforms to procedures at least as thorough as those used for their similarly-sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Decisions regarding what collateral must be taken to secure a loan are based on the circumstances of the individual loan, including size, and must meet the minimum requirements set forth in this section. a) For loans of $50,000 or less, Lenders are not required to take collateral. b) For loans over $50,000, the Lender must follow the written collateral policies and procedures that it has established and implemented for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, except for Export Express lines of credit over $50,000 used to support the issuance of a standby letter of credit. The line of credit must have collateral (cash, cash equivalent or project) that will provide coverage for at least 25% of the issued standby letter of credit amount. ii. Adequacy of Collateral: a) A Lender may not take any action in connection with an SBA- guaranteed loan that establishes a preference in favor of the Lender ( 13 CFR § 120.411). The Lender must not have a 7(a) loan in a “piggyback” structure. i) Piggyback financing occurs when one or more lenders provide more than one loan to a single Borrower at or about the same time, financing the same or similar purpose, and where the SBA-guaranteed loan is secured with a junior lien position or no lien position on the collateral securing the non-guaranteed loan(s). SBA considers “at or about the same time” to mean loans approved within 90 days of each other. ii) SBA does not consider a scenario where both the SBA-guaranteed loan and the non-SBA guaranteed loan are for working capital and the non-SBA guaranteed loan is secured only by working/trading assets to be a piggyback structure.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_205_291168639", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

In fact, one of the primary reasons Lenders use the SBA- guaranteed program is for those Applicants that demonstrate repayment ability but lack adequate collateral to repay the loan in full in the event of default. However, SBA does not permit its guaranty to be a substitute for available collateral. d. Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements The regulation governing real estate appraisals is set forth at 13 CFR § 120.160(b). i. Commercial Real Estate: a) For all loans secured by commercial real property when loan proceeds will be used to acquire, refinance or improve real estate: i) If the loan finances a transaction involving parties with a close relationship (for example, transactions between existing owners or family members), or if the Lender otherwise concludes that an appraisal is necessary to appropriately evaluate creditworthiness, the Lender must obtain an appraisal. ii) Appraisals must be in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Additionally, SBA requires that completed appraisals be dated within 12 months of the application for guaranty. iii) If an appraisal is not required under the preceding paragraph, all Lenders must obtain an appropriate evaluation of the commercial real estate securing the loan that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Evaluations are not required to be performed in accordance with USPAP or by State licensed or certified appraisers but should be consistent with the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines and the Interagency Advisory on the Use of Evaluations in Real Estate-Related Financial Transactions, issued by the Federal Banking Regulators. b) The appraiser must be: i) Independent and have no appearance of a conflict of interest (such as a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the property or transaction, independent of the loan production function, and not involved in the approval of the transaction); and ii) Either State-licensed or State-certified, with the following exception: when the commercial property’s estimated value is over $1,000,000, the appraiser must be State-certified.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_206_832266593", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender may not use an appraisal prepared for the seller or the Applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Applicant. d) The appraisal must be an “Appraisal Report” prepared in compliance with USPAP. e) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.) After construction is completed, Lender must obtain a statement from the appraiser, general contractor, project architect, or construction management firm that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based. If the Lender cannot obtain such a statement, then the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission. f) If the SBA-guaranteed loan was used to cover the construction period, the Lender must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any deviation(s) and work with the SBA CLSC to determine an appropriate course of action, including the securing of additional collateral. The Lender’s notification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. If the Lender is unable to obtain a statement that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based, but is able to obtain a new appraisal demonstrating that the market value meets or exceeds the original estimate of value, then no additional action on the part of the Lender is necessary. g) If the loan will be used to acquire an existing building that does not require construction, the appraiser should estimate market value on an as-is basis. If the appraiser estimates the value other than on an as-is basis, the narrative must include an explanation of why the as-is basis was not used.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_207_933477165", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

In no case may the Lender rely on an appraisal that was prepared more than 12 months prior to the date of the application. j) If the Lender is going to require the appraisal at closing, the loan application must include an estimate of the value of the real estate and the estimate must be identified in the Lender’s credit memorandum with the requirement for an appraisal that supports the estimated value at time of closing. k) If at time of closing the appraised value: i) Is 90% or more of the estimated value, the Lender may close the loan but must include a written explanation as to why the appraisal is less than the estimated value in the loan file. ii) Is less than 90% of the estimated value, Export Express Lenders are permitted to close the loan, but the Lender must include a written justification as part of its file that may be reviewed by SBA at time of guaranty purchase or when conducting lender oversight activities. The justification must include a thorough analysis by the Lender of the reasons for the appraisal being low and an explanation as to what steps the Lender took to offset the risk to SBA from the low appraisal such as additional equity or additional collateral. ii. Non-commercial real estate or real estate securing a personal guaranty: SBA has no specific appraisal requirements for non-commercial real estate (such as a residence) or real estate (commercial or non-commercial) taken as collateral to secure a personal guaranty. iii. Other Fixed Assets: If the valuation of fixed assets is greater than their Net Book Value , an independent appraisal by a qualified individual must be obtained by the Lender to support the higher valuation. The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. A valuation of the fixed assets provided as part of a business valuation will not meet these requirements, except as part of a going concern appraisal. iv. Business Valuation Requirements – Change of Ownership: a) Determining the value of a business (not including real estate which is separately valued through a real estate appraisal) is the key component to the analysis of any loan application for a change of ownership. An accurate business valuation is required because the change in ownership will result in new debt unrelated to business operations and potentially", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_208_814465762", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

A business valuation assists the buyer in making a determination that the seller’s asking price is supported by an independent Qualified Source (See definition in Appendix 3). b) In order for the individual performing the business valuation to identify the scope of work appropriately, the business valuation must be requested by and prepared for the Lender. The scope of work should identify whether the transaction is an asset purchase or stock purchase and be specific enough for the individual performing the business valuation to know what is included in the sale (including any assumed debt). The business valuation must include the individual’s conclusion of value, the qualifications of the individual performing the business valuation and their signature certifying to the information contained in the business valuation. The Lender may not use a business valuation prepared for the Applicant or the seller. The cost of the business valuation may be passed on to the Applicant. i) Non-Special Purpose Properties: (a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the Lender’s internal policies and procedures require an independent business valuation from a Qualified Source. (b) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment is greater than $250,000 or if there is a close relationship between the buyer and seller (for example, transactions between existing owners or family members), the Lender must obtain an independent business valuation from a Qualified S ource. ii) Special Purpose Properties: A “Special Purpose Property” is a limited- market property with a unique physical design, special construction materials, or a layout that restricts its utility to the specific use for which it was built. (a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the Lender’s internal policies and procedures require an independent business valuation from a Qualified Source.

The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. (c) The business valuation must allocate separate values to the individual components of the transaction including land, building, equipment, and intangible assets. (d) The Certified General Real Property Appraiser must have completed no less than four going concern appraisals of equivalent special use property as the property being appraised, within the last 36 months, as identified in the qualifications portion of the Appraisal Report. (e) Each business valuation assignment under this section must be undertaken with a specific instruction for the Certified General Real Property Appraiser to conduct the appraisal in compliance with current USPAP guidelines. iii) The business valuation may be obtained and reviewed after the issuance of an SBA Loan Number and prior to closing. If the Lender requests the business valuation after issuance of an SBA Loan Number, the credit memorandum must include an estimate of the value of the business. The credit memorandum must be updated after receipt of the business valuation to include a comparison of the loan amount and the business valuation. iv) Any amount(s) of the loan proceeds that will be used to facilitate a change of ownership may not exceed the business valuation. v) Lender Verification of Business valuation Financial Data: Lender must obtain a copy of the financial information relied upon by the individual who performed the business valuation and verify that information against the seller’s IRS transcripts to ensure the accuracy of the information. 5.

Lenders must submit the information required in SBA Form 1919 and loan terms and conditions into E-Tran. a) Lender must submit to E-Tran all terms and conditions the E-Tran data fields require. b) SBA Form 1919 : A separate SBA Form 1919 for each co-borrower must be completed and signed by the authorized representative of the Applicant and submitted to the Lender. The aggregate amounts of the “Purpose of the loan” sections across all SBA Forms 1919 should equal the total amount of the loan request. Only the information required on SBA Form 1919, and not the form itself, must be submitted into E-Tran, although the Lender must obtain and retain the signed form in its file. c) Lender’s Credit Memorandum must address all requirements detailed in paragraph 4, Credit Standards, above. d) Tax transcripts in accordance with Section A, Chapter 5, Para. B, IRS Tax Transcript/Verification of Financial Information: If the Lender uses business financial information to determine the creditworthiness of an SBA Loan, the Lender must compare the tax data received from the IRS with the financial data or tax returns submitted with the loan application. If the Lender does not use business financial information to determine creditworthiness, such as with some credit scoring models, reconciliation of the tax transcripts is not required. b.

EXPORT WORKING CAPITAL PROGRAM (EWCP) 13 CFR 120.340–- 120.344 Under the EWCP, SBA guarantees short-term working capital loans made by participating lenders to small business Exporters engaged in Export Transactions. Lenders must always start by reviewing the contents of Section A, Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans. 1. Eligibility for EWCP In addition to the Core Requirements identified in Section A, the following EWCP- specific eligibility requirements apply: Eligibility for EWCP will be limited to businesses that have a history of at least 12 full months of operations prior to filing an application. The SBA Approving Official may waive the 12-month requirement, based upon demonstrated Export Transaction expertise and previous business experience. Export management companies (EMC) or export trading companies (ETC) may use this program only if the EMC or ETC takes title to the goods or services in the Export Transaction. EMCs or ETCs which have any bank ownership are ineligible for the EWCP loan program. 2. Eligible Uses of Proceeds for EWCP Proceeds can be used only to finance Export Transactions. Loans can be for single or multiple Export Transactions. i. Loan proceeds may be used for: a) Acquiring inventory for export or to be used to manufacture goods for export; b) Paying the manufacturing costs of goods for export; c) Purchasing goods or services for export; d) Supporting standby letters of credit related to export transactions e) For working capital directly related to export orders f) For foreign accounts receivable and inventory financing g) Support an Indirect Export : The term “indirect export” applies to situations where, although the Borrower’s direct customer is located in the United States, that customer will be exporting the items/services it purchased from the Borrower to a foreign Buyer. In such cases, the Borrower must provide documentation to the Lender from the Borrower’s domestic customer (typically in the form of a letter, invoice, order, or contract) that the goods or services are in fact being exported. h) Pre-shipment working capital supporting Export Transactions;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_213_645651995", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Loan proceeds may not be used to (13 CFR § 120.342): a) Support the Borrower’s domestic sales, except in the case of an indirect export; b) Acquire fixed assets or capital goods for use in the Borrower’s business; c) Finance pre-shipment or purchase order financing under a transaction- specific or transaction-based revolving EWCP facility for Foreign-to- Foreign Export Transactions. d) Acquire, equip, or rent commercial space overseas; or e) Finance professional export marketing advice or services, foreign business travel, participation in trade shows or support staff in overseas offices, except to the extent it relates directly to the transaction being financed. Debt Refinancing with Export Working Capital Program (EWCP) Loans. EWCP loan proceeds may not be used to pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss (including the same institution’s debt). This includes refinancing debt that will shift all or part of a potential loss from the original Lender to the SBA. 13 CFR §§ 120.140(j)(1) and 120.201 EWCP loan proceeds may be used to refinance an existing EWCP loan or export line of credit. All refinanced debts must be supported by active export sales or pending export orders, and the EWCP terms and conditions in E-Tran must specify additional eligible uses of loan proceeds for subsequent draws. The following conditions apply to debt refinancing under EWCP: i. The loan being refinanced must be paid off with the EWCP loan, and the refinanced loan must be terminated after the pay-off. ii. EWCP loan proceeds may not be used to refinance debt that is already on reasonable terms. iii. An existing EWCP loan or other short-term export line of credit reflected on the Applicant’s business balance sheet may be eligible for refinancing if it is reflected on the Applicant’s business tax returns (Schedule C for sole proprietorships) showing the interest expense associated with the debt. a) If the debt to be refinanced was the first extension of credit, the Lender must document and the Applicant must certify that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business, for an eligible purpose under 13 CFR § 120.342, and were not used for any ineligible purpose as set forth in 13 CFR § 120.130; and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_214_143539259", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the term of the debt to be refinanced is less than the period of two full tax cycles prior to application, the loan being refinanced, including the associated interest, must be reflected on the Applicant’s balance sheet and business tax returns for the full tax cycle(s) that occurred between the date of disbursement of the loan being refinanced and the date of application for the EWCP loan. iv. When refinancing debt, the loan application must include: a) A written analysis that addresses the following issues: i) The reason the debt was incurred; ii) The factor(s) that support that the proposed refinancing will not pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss; iii) The reason for restructuring the debt (for example, over-obligated or imprudent borrowing); iv) The factor(s) that support that the debt being refinanced is not currently on reasonable terms; v) How the new loan will improve the financial condition of the Applicant; vi) The reason(s) the Lender believes the debt to be refinanced no longer meets the needs of the Applicant; and b) Supporting documentation for each debt to be refinanced: Lenders are required to: i) Retain copies of notes, security agreements, leases, and other documentation evidencing the debt to be refinanced; and ii) Submit with the application to LGPC for non-delegated loans, copies of all supporting documentation for the debt to be refinanced. v. Other conditions that apply to debt refinancing: a) A 7(a) loan may not be used to refinance a debt owed to a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) or a New Markets Venture Capital Company 13 CFR § 120.130(b) . b) The payment of trade payables is not considered to be debt refinancing. c) Initial disbursement must be made in accordance with the E-Tran terms and conditions; d) Prior to first disbursement, the Lender must ensure:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_215_223763718", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Change of Ownership (13 CFR § 120.202). EWCP loan proceeds may not be used for a change of ownership. 3. Ineligible NAICS Codes For purposes of clarification, small businesses in the following NAICS Industry Subsector Codes cannot be financed using an EWCP loan, but may be financed using other SBA 7(a) financial assistance: NAICS Industry Subsector Code 721 (Accommodation) NAICS Industry Subsector Code 457 (Gasoline Stations). 4. Other Restrictions that Apply to PLP-EWCP Loans The following types of loans are not eligible for PLP-EWCP processing: Loans to a cooperative or to an eligible small business owned or controlled by a cooperative (see Section A, Ch. 2, Para. B.3., Cooperatives, for more information); Loans involving a Single Employer 401(k) plan, including a ROBS plan, unless the only investment held by the 401(k) plan at the time of application is the equity in the Applicant business; and Loans involving a Multiple-Employer 401(k) plan (i.e., a plan that holds in trust the assets of other businesses), including a ROBS plan (see Section A, Ch. 2, Para. B.4., 401(k) Plans Including Rollovers as Business Start-Ups (ROBS) Plans, for more information). 5. Loan Terms and Conditions for EWCP a. Maximum Loan Amount i. The maximum loan amount is $5,000,000. ii. Maximum Loans to Businesses with Affiliates 13 CFR § 120.151 Lenders must determine whether the Applicant has any affiliates and document the results in their credit analysis. If affiliation exists, SBA’s loan maximums apply to the Applicant, including all affiliates, as if all were a single business. b. Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages Except for EWCP and International Trade loans, the maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business (including affiliates) must not exceed $3,750,000. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. However, both EWCP and International Trade loans permit a", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_216_644755308", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount for a revolving line of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.” i. The maximum guaranty amount is $4,500,000. ii. For EWCP, the guaranty percentage is 90 percent. iii. Zero Percent Guaranty Cannot be Provided for Ineligible Purposes: A 7(a) loan cannot include proceeds for an ineligible purpose or have any portion of the loan made to an ineligible business and no part of an SBA 7(a) loan may be guaranteed at zero percent. iv. Combination of 7(a) and 504 loans. a) When an Applicant applies for any combination of 7(a) and 504 loans, the order in which the loans are approved determines the maximum loan and guaranty amount available. Because the 7(a) loan has a lower maximum guaranteed amount, the 7(a) loan should be processed and approved first. b) Lenders must advise the SBA processing centers that there is a companion 504 application to ensure the 7(a) loan is processed and approved prior to the 504 loan application being processed and approved. c. Loan Maturities i. The loan term must be the shortest appropriate term based on the use of proceeds and the Borrower’s ability to repay. ii. General: The maximum maturity of an EWCP loan is 36 months. The maturity date is set in terms of the number of months from either the date of Note or the date of initial disbursement to the date when final payment is due. SBA’s guaranty remains in effect for disbursements made through the maturity date. With the exception of a disbursement made to fund a draw against a Standby Letter(s) of Credit that was issued under the EWCP before the maturity date, disbursements made after the maturity date are not covered under the guaranty. The maturity of the loan is: a) The date specified in E-Tran. Such date will not be longer than 36 months from the Note date. If the loan is not reissued, or extended, all outstanding amounts are due and payable on that day. b) Standby Letters of Credit. Unless SBA provides prior written consent, Standby Letters of Credit supported by an EWCP loan must expire before the loan maturity date. If the Lender receives SBA’s prior written consent and makes a disbursement after the maturity date because there has been a draw on a standby letter of credit which was issued under the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_217_213218806", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Specific Types of EWCP loans: a) Single Transaction-Specific Loan: A non-revolving loan or revolving line of credit that supports a specifically identified, single export transaction. The LGPC (if processed non-delegated) or PLP-EWCP Lender (if processed via PLP-EWCP authority) may approve a term up to 36 months to correspond with the length of the transaction cycle. When the term exceeds 12 months, justification and recommendation for a longer maturity must be included in the Lender’s credit memorandum (if processed via PLP-EWCP) or in the SBA Export Finance Manager’s credit memorandum (if processed non-delegated). (Export Finance Managers are assigned to United States Export Assistance Centers (USEACs).) b) Transaction Based-Revolving Line of Credit: A revolving line of credit can support either multiple export transactions or a single, specifically identified export transaction on a continuous basis during the term of the loan. While the term of a revolving line of credit typically does not exceed 12 months, LGPC or PLP-EWCP Lender may allow an initial commitment up to 36 months with annual renewals. c) Asset Based Loans (ABLs): ABLs are revolving lines of credit supported by a monthly BBC which reports levels of assets, normally accounts receivable and inventory, supporting the loan amount. ABLs are typically committed for 12 months and re-issued annually. Because a re-issuance of a loan is a new loan, another guaranty fee is due each time the loan is re-issued. ABLs, however, can have up to a 36-month maturity with annual renewals. The Lender must supply to SBA updated financial statements on the Borrower annually. d. Interest Rates i. SBA does not prescribe the interest rates for the EWCP but will monitor these rates for reasonableness. 13 CFR § 120.344(c) a) A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The Lender negotiates the interest rate with the Applicant. b) The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. For further discussion of variable interest rates, see paragraph ii., “Policy on Variable Interest Rates” below. c) Default interest rates are not permitted. d) For loans with a variable interest rate, the following terms must be defined:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_218_796117576", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

After final disbursement, Lender must either notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. ii. Policy on Variable Interest Rates a) Post-Approval Changes to the Interest Rate: i) Pre-Disbursement Changes: After loan approval and prior to first disbursement, the Lender may change the initial Note rate, including changing the base rate, the spread over the base rate, or changed from a fixed rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, provided the new interest rate is reasonable. SBA will monitor these rates for reasonableness. 13 CFR § 120.344(c) The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must notify the LGPC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed. The Borrower has asked the Lender if the loan can be switched to a fixed rate. If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected is reasonable, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. ii) Post-Disbursement Changes: After the loan is disbursed, on a variable rate loan, the Lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate, provided the new base rate or spread is reasonable. SBA will monitor these rates for reasonableness. 13 CFR § 120.344(c) The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written agreement and must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For further guidance see SOP 50 57. b) Interest Rate Requirements for an SBA Note: i) For fixed rate loans, the Lender must state the specific interest rate in the Note. ii) For variable rate loans, the Lender must include the following information in the Note: (a) Identification of the rate being used as the base rate;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_219_102153349", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Fixed and Variable Rate Combinations: The Lender may use a fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and a variable rate on the other portion of the loan. SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a variable interest rate on the unguaranteed portion and sell a fixed rate guaranteed portion on the Secondary Market. If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. e. Payment Options for EWCP Ongoing Guaranty Fee i. For EWCP loans approved after September 27, 2010, the Lender may choose one of the following options for payment of the EWCP Ongoing Fee only. Either option (monthly or annually) will result in payment of the same total amount of EWCP Ongoing Fee on each EWCP loan. Regardless of which payment option is chosen, the Lender must continue to submit, on a monthly basis, the Lender’s SBA Form 1502 Report on all 7(a) loans in the Lender’s portfolio, including all EWCP loans. a) Option 1 – Monthly Payment of EWCP Ongoing Fee: Option 1 allows Lenders to pay the EWCP Ongoing Fee monthly along with other 7(a) loan ongoing servicing fees to the Fiscal Transfer Agent with the required SBA Form 1502 Report. Because EWCP loans may be a small percentage of the Lender’s 7(a) portfolio, Option 1 allows Lenders to voluntarily pay the EWCP Ongoing Fee on each EWCP loan on a monthly basis along with the rest of their 7(a) portfolio. b) Option 2 – Annual Payment of EWCP Ongoing Fee: Lenders may pay the EWCP Ongoing Fee on each EWCP loan annually by selecting Option 2. Lenders selecting Option 2 will receive an annual invoice on each EWCP loan from SBA’s DFC.

The vast majority of EWCP loans have a maturity of 12 months or less; however, EWCP loans may have a maturity of up to 36 months. For EWCP loans with a maturity of 12 months or less, Lenders will receive one EWCP Ongoing Fee invoice after maturity. For EWCP loans with a maturity in excess of 12 months and not more than 24 months, Lenders will receive an EWCP Ongoing Fee invoice 12 months after closing and again after maturity. For EWCP loans with a maturity greater than 24 months, Lenders will receive an EWCP Ongoing Fee invoice 12 months after closing, 24 months after closing and again after maturity. The DFC will mail the Lender an EWCP Ongoing Fee invoice on each EWCP loan within 60 days of each 12-month interval on the EWCP loan and payment will be due within 30 days of the date of the invoice. The invoice will be for the EWCP Ongoing Fee amount owing for the previous 12 months, or shorter period for loans maturing prior to the end of the 12-month period. Lenders will be given instructions on the invoice to make payment using the Pay.gov online payment process. Fiscal Transfer Agent will send monthly EWCP reports to DFC and SBA’s Office of International Trade (OIT). This report will track information on each EWCP loan by Lender, including but not limited to the following: i) Whether the Lender is submitting SBA Form 1502 Reports on EWCP loans as required; ii) When annual invoices are to be sent; and iii) The accrued amount to be billed for the EWCP Ongoing Fee for each EWCP loan. ii. The DFC will send a monthly report to OIT and SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management reporting any Lenders that are delinquent on payments of invoiced EWCP Ongoing Fees. OIT will be responsible (through delegation to the Export Finance Manager) for monitoring Lenders in regard to submitting the required SBA Form 1502 Reports and the payment of the required EWCP Ongoing Fees. A Lender’s failure to pay any of the fees (and any interest and penalties that are subsequently charged by SBA due to a lender’s delinquent payment) may result in SBA’s decision to suspend or revoke a lender’s eligibility to participate in SBA’s 7(a) program or to limit a lender’s delegated authority. 6. Credit Standards for EWCP The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150 . This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_221_714462872", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

EWCP loans are self-liquidating loans, and the conversion of the export-related trading assets to cash is the primary source of repayment. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the conversion of foreign sales into cash, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. a. Processing Methods Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened- out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its PLP- EWCP authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s PLP-EWCP authority for a period of 12 months from the date of the withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. i. Non-delegated – When a Lender submits an EWCP loan guaranty request under the non-delegated processing method, the Lender submits the application and supporting documents to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan and any equity injection to be required from the Applicant. ii. Delegated – When a Lender submits an EWCP loan guaranty request under the Lender’s PLP-EWCP authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan or line of credit prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The PLP- EWCP Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. b. Underwriting Lender must submit a credit memorandum with the application and analyze each EWCP request in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. EWCP loans are self-liquidating loans and the conversion of the export-related trading assets to cash is the primary source of repayment. The Lender’s financial analysis should pay particular attention to the Applicant’s foreign payment terms and the impact on the Applicant’s cash cycle. Lender must specify whether the request is for a single transaction-specific loan, a transaction- based revolving line of credit (single or multiple transactions), or an asset-based loan. c. Credit Analysis Lender’s credit analysis must include the following: i. An explanation of the use of proceeds and benefits of the loan guaranty, including details of the underlying transaction(s) for which the loan is needed and the country(ies) where the buyer(s) is (are) located;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_222_217035292", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

A discussion of Lender’s credit experience with the Applicant and a review of business and personal credit reports. d. Collateral See Section A, Ch. 5, Para. A. for guaranty requirements. i. EWCP loans must be secured by no less than a first security interest in all collateral associated with the transactions financed. This includes at least the export inventory and receivables, assignment of credit insurance, letters of credit proceeds, and contract proceeds as applicable. Collateral must be located in the United States, its territories, or possessions. An assignment of contract proceeds for an EWCP Asset Based Line of Credit may be required at the discretion of the LGPC for non-delegated loans, or the PLP-EWCP Lender for EWCP loans processed under delegated authority. In general, the export-related inventory produced and the foreign accounts receivables generated by the export sales financed will be considered to provide adequate collateral coverage. SBA, for non-delegated loans, or the PLP-EWCP Lender, may require additional collateral by requiring a lien on other business assets. When EWCP loan proceeds are used for debt refinancing, collateral for the loan being refinanced must be transferred to secure the EWCP loan. ii. Standby Letters of Credit: SBA requires additional collateral if an EWCP loan is used to support the issuance of a standby letter of credit. In such situations, the Applicant must deposit cash into an account held by the Lender in an amount equal to at least 25% of the standby letter of credit being issued. This deposit must remain in the account held by the Lender for the term of the standby letter of credit. If using an asset-based loan (ABL) facility, SBA, for non-delegated loans, or the PLP-EWCP Lender may allow export inventory and/or foreign accounts receivable or other acceptable collateral to replace the cash deposit requirement. The Lender must determine that the borrowing base for the ABL will support at least 25% of the total of all standby letters of credit supported by the loan. All Lenders must document the method used to secure the additional collateral in their file. iii. Receivables generated from sales to foreign purchasers are not considered a foreign asset and may be taken as collateral. iv. Personal guaranties of all 20% or more owners is generally required, but may be waived by the Director, International Trade Finance (D/ITF). 7.

Lenders that executed an earlier version of SBA Form 750, and that also have an executed SBA Form 750EX, are permitted to submit applications for an EWCP guaranty under non-delegated processing procedures. If a Lender has an earlier version of the SBA Form 750, but no executed SBA Form 750EX, the Lender must execute a July 1, 2019, version of the SBA Form 750 in order to submit an EWCP application. All Lenders with an executed July 1, 2019, version of SBA Form 750 are eligible to submit EWCP applications for guaranty under non-delegated processing procedures. Lenders with an executed SBA Form 2310, “Supplemental Guaranty Agreement Preferred Lenders Program (PLP) for Export Working Capital Program (EWCP) Loans,” may process EWCP applications under delegated authority. For all loans submitted using the non-delegated process through the LGPC (including loans from PLP-EWCP Lenders using this processing method), the Lender must submit applications for guaranty and all attachments via E-Tran to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the uses of proceeds, the adequacy of the collateral being pledged, the structure of the loan and any equity injection to be required from the Applicant and will either approve or decline the loan in E-Tran. a. Contents of Lender’s Application for Guaranty The contents of the Lender’s application for guaranty vary depending on the method of processing chosen by the Lender. Based on the method of processing, the Lender may or may not be required to submit the documentation and exhibits to SBA, but in all cases must maintain those documents and any that support the guaranty request in their loan files. Lender must list in E-Tran all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant, and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant. SBA Form 1919 includes information on the number of existing employees at the time of application and the number of jobs to be created and/or retained as a result of the loan. • Number of existing employees at the time of application is calculated in accordance with 13 CFR § 121.106 , which states in part that SBA counts all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis (i.e., jobs are not converted to full-time equivalents). • Jobs “created” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees that the small business expects to hire as a result of the loan. • Jobs “retained” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees on the payroll of the business at the time of application that will be lost if the loan is not approved . • “Employees” does not include contractors reported via IRS Form 1099. i.

See Chapter 5, Para. D.2 of this Section below for additional requirements for Note terms. Advances and Receivables i. On Single Transaction-Specific Loans and Transaction-Based Revolving Lines of Credit where draws are made against foreign purchase orders or contracts, the maximum advance rate is 90% of the purchase order/contract or the Borrower’s costs (including overhead), whichever is less. Foreign accounts receivable will be captured by the Lender through the use of a control account and applied against the outstanding loan balance. ii. On an asset-based revolving line of credit where advances are made against a borrowing base of foreign receivables and/or export-related inventory, the maximum advance rates are 90% on eligible foreign receivables and 75% on eligible export-related inventory located within the United States. Control accounts may be required at the discretion of the LGPC for non-delegated loans, or PLP-EWCP Lender for loans processed under delegated authority. At a minimum, the Borrower must submit a Borrowing Base Certificate (BBC) to the Lender at least monthly, or as frequently as the Lender customarily requires from its Borrowers on similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed loans if more often than monthly, along with an aging of foreign accounts receivable and listing of export-related inventory, as appropriate. If the borrowing base shows the Borrower is over-advanced, the Lender must immediately require the Borrower to make a payment to reduce the loan balance so it is within the borrowing base formula. iii. Advance rates on foreign purchase orders/contracts or foreign accounts receivable when sold on open account (no credit insurance or letter of credit to mitigate the foreign risk) may not exceed 80%. When approving uninsured buyers: a) the exporter must provide favorable ledger experience with specific buyers over a significant period of time (at a minimum, 24 months) in countries with acceptable commercial or political risk. The limits extended on any uninsured buyers must be commensurate with the sales levels during the ledger history period; or b) The uninsured foreign accounts receivables are from credit-worthy buyers (e.g., financially sound corporations; multinational or publicly- traded companies), located in countries with acceptable commercial; or c) The uninsured foreign accounts receivables are from credit-worthy government entities in countries with acceptable commercial or political risk. iv.

If the Lender is a PLP-EWCP Lender, the Lender may advance up to 90% against uninsured foreign accounts receivable when: a) The uninsured foreign accounts receivables are from credit-worthy buyers (e.g., financially sound corporations; multinational or publicly- traded companies), located in countries with acceptable commercial; or b) The uninsured foreign accounts receivables are from credit-worthy government entities in countries with acceptable commercial or political risk. When establishing an advance rate on uninsured foreign accounts receivable in excess of 80%, the PLP-EWCP Lender must document its loan file with the analysis and justification to support the higher advance rate. vi. Foreign Accounts Receivable: a) Terms of Sale: i) Payment terms must be in compliance with the terms and conditions in E-Tran. The Ex-Im Bank Country Limitation Schedule must be reviewed for prohibited countries (such countries are identified by Note # 7 on the Ex-Im Schedule) and the Department of Treasury OFAC sanctions lists must also be reviewed at sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/ . (a) For federally-regulated Lenders, compliance with the procedures required by the Lender’s Federal Financial Institution Regulator will constitute compliance with the above referenced OFAC requirement. (b) For SBA Supervised Lenders, Lender must check the OFAC sanctions lists prior to first disbursement of funds on each specific export transaction. ii) Payment terms must be in line with prudent lending practices. Typical terms of sale include but are not limited to: (a) Confirmed irrevocable letter(s) of credit (SBA or the PLP-EWCP Lender may require for some or all of the Borrower’s foreign accounts). Foreign accounts receivable supported by acceptable letters of credit must not exceed 364 days from the invoice date; (b) Irrevocable letter(s) of credit (SBA or the PLP-EWCP Lender may require for some or all of the Borrower’s foreign accounts). Foreign accounts receivable supported by acceptable letters of credit must not exceed 364 days from the invoice date; (c) Open account insured through Ex-Im Bank or private sector export credit insurance for comprehensive commercial and political risk (SBA or the PLP-EWCP Lender may determine that export credit insurance is required to enhance the quality of foreign accounts", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_231_931898232", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Foreign accounts receivable supported by credit insurance must not exceed 180 days from the invoice date; (d) Cash payment received prior to shipment; (e) Open account uninsured, with SBA’s prior written consent or documented by the PLP-EWCP Lender. Open account uninsured foreign accounts receivable must not exceed 180 days from the invoice date; and (f) Sight draft documents against payment, with SBA’s prior written consent. b) Jurisdiction and Currency of Foreign Accounts Receivable: Foreign accounts receivable held as collateral should be payable to the Borrower in the United States and in United States dollars. Foreign accounts receivable due and payable in non-U.S. currency may be allowed on a case-by-case basis with SBA’s prior written consent or authorized by the PLP-EWCP Lender. Depending on the stability of the currency in question, SBA may require that the Borrower mitigate the risk through hedging (purchasing of a forward currency contract, forward option, or similar mechanism) as a condition of such approval. When advancing against a transaction payable in a foreign currency, Lender must use an established foreign exchange rate and must retain documentation showing the exchange rate used and the Lender’s calculation of the amount of the advance. c) Control Accounts: i) For the “single transaction-specific” and “transaction based-revolving line of credit” EWCP loans, Lenders will be required to set up a control account to capture the proceeds of foreign accounts receivable as they are paid by the foreign buyers. The proceeds are required to be applied against the loan balance, either in their entirety or as a percentage of the proceeds in a sufficient amount to pay off the initial advance for that specific transaction. ii) For asset-based loans, LGPC for non-delegated loans, or the PLP- EWCP Lender for delegated loans, will determine if a control account is required based on the credit analysis. Normally, Lenders must have 100% of the foreign accounts receivable proceeds applied against the loan balance and have the Borrower request additional advances as needed based on a BBC. Another available option is to allow for the Borrower to maintain a balance within the Borrowing Base limits and to retain foreign accounts receivable proceeds (not applied to the loan balance upon collection). At a minimum, the Borrower must submit a BBC to the Lender at least monthly, or as frequently as the Lender customarily requires from its Borrowers on similarly-sized, non-SBA", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_232_920638015", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender will review the Borrowing Base to assure the Borrower is not over-advanced according to the available collateral detailed on the BBC. If the Borrower is over-advanced per the Borrowing Base, the Lender will require the Borrower to immediately make a payment to reduce the loan balance to be in compliance. For a small business with an asset-based loan to be allowed to retain the foreign accounts receivable proceeds, the small business must: (a) Be in business for at least 2 years (no start-ups); and (b) Have financial records satisfactory to SBA for non-delegated loans, or the PLP-EWCP Lender for delegated loans, and the ability to provide a current aging of foreign accounts receivable. In deciding whether to permit a small business to retain the foreign accounts receivable proceeds, the PLP-EWCP Lender must comply with its policies and procedures for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed credit facilities. iii) Foreign Accounts Receivable Restrictions: Unless the Lender receives SBA’s prior written consent, any of the following types of accounts receivable are not eligible for inclusion in an asset-based loan borrowing base: (a) An account receivable that does not arise from the sale of items in the ordinary course of the Borrower’s business; (b) An account receivable from a domestic (U.S.) company, unless the transaction has been approved by SBA as an indirect export; (c) An account receivable for which an invoice has not been sent; (d) An account receivable that is due and payable from a foreign buyer located in a country with which SBA is legally prohibited from doing business as set forth in the current Ex-Im Bank Country Limitation Schedule (such countries are identified by Note # 7 on the Schedule). (If the Borrower has knowledge that an export to a country in which SBA may do business, as set forth in the Ex-Im Bank Country Limitation Schedule, will be re-exported to a country with which SBA is legally prohibited from doing business, the corresponding receivables are not eligible for inclusion in the export-related borrowing base.); (e) A foreign account receivable that, by its original terms, is due and payable more than 180 calendar days from the date of the invoice, except those accounts receivable supported by acceptable letters of credit or credit insurance; (f) A foreign account receivable that is still outstanding more than 60 calendar days from its original due date;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_233_611410383", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Eligibility for International Trade Loans In addition to the core requirements identified in Section A, the Applicant must demonstrate either b and d, or c and d below in order to be eligible: The loan proceeds will expand existing export markets or develop new export markets. To establish this, the Applicant must submit an export business plan, including both a projection and narrative rationale that contains enough information to reasonably support the likelihood of expanded export sales. i. The plan should identify the amount of expected export sales. ii. Indirect exports are considered exports for purposes of determining eligibility. The term “indirect export” applies to situations where, although the Applicant’s direct customer is located in the United States, that customer will be exporting the items/services it purchased from the Applicant to a foreign Buyer. iii. In such cases, the Applicant must provide documentation to the Lender from the Applicant’s domestic customer (typically in the form of a letter, invoice, order, or contract) that the goods or services are in fact being exported. iv. For all of the Applicant’s exports (including indirect exports), the Lender must determine if U.S. companies are authorized to conduct business with the country to which the goods or services will be shipped, pursuant to the Ex-Im Bank Country Limitation Schedule. A loan may not be made to a business that directly or indirectly exports to a foreign country which is listed as a prohibited country (Note #7) on the Country Limitation Schedule; OR That the Applicant is adversely affected by import competition. i. The Applicant must demonstrate injury attributable to increased competition with foreign firms in the relevant market. ii. A narrative explanation and financial statements showing that imported products or services which are directly competitive with those produced by the Applicant have contributed significantly to a decline in competitive position are required. iii. Alternatively, the Applicant can submit a finding of injury by the International Trade Commission or the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Chapter 3 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341 et seq.), AND In addition to either paragraphs a or b above, the Applicant must demonstrate the loan will allow the Applicant to improve its competitive position.

NAICS Industry Subsector Code 721 (Accommodation) ii. NAICS Industry Subsector Code 457 (Gasoline Stations). 2. Eligible Uses of Proceeds for International Trade Loans Proceeds of an IT loan may only be used for the following eligible purposes (proceeds of an IT loan may not be used for any other purpose): i. Acquire, construct, renovate, modernize, improve, or expand facilities and equipment to be used in the United States to produce goods or services involved in international trade and to develop and penetrate foreign markets; ii. Working Capital; iii. Debt Refinancing with an International Trade (IT) loan. SBA-guaranteed loan proceeds may not be used to pay a creditor in a position to sustain a loss (including the same institution’s debt). This includes any refinancing that will shift all or part of a potential loss from the original lender to the SBA. 13 CFR §§ 120.140(j)(1) and 120.201 . i) In accordance with 13 CFR § 120.452, a Lender may not use PLP delegated authority to reduce the Lender’s credit exposure to the Applicant.

To be eligible for refinancing, any seller financed note must have been in place and current (not on standby) for at least 24 months following the change of ownership. The refinancing request must meet the SBA 10 percent improvement to installment payment amount requirement in paragraph iv) below. If the change of ownership is between existing owners of a business and existing business debt will be refinanced as part of the transaction, the refinancing must meet the requirements set forth in this section. If the existing debt is SBA-guaranteed and with the same Lender (SID), the application can be processed under PLP authority. Paying off debt as part of a change of ownership is not a refinance of debt. In a complete change of ownership situation, the option to assume the existing SBA debt should be offered to the buyer. (h) Debt reflected on the Applicant’s business balance sheet is eligible for refinancing if the Applicant certified that the debt is reflected on the Applicant’s business tax returns (Schedule C for sole proprietorships) showing the interest expense associated with the debt. If a Lender submits a loan with proceeds refinanced from debt on the Applicant’s business balance sheet where the Applicant certified that the proceeds from the debt were used exclusively for the Applicant’s business but the Applicant certification is determined to be invalid, SBA will not use this as a basis to deny or repair the guaranty purchase request.

(c) Interim Advances: For loans processed non-delegated, but prior to disbursement, a Lender or an affiliate of the Lender may make interim advances (also known as bridge loans) and SBA loan proceeds may be used to reimburse the interim advances. Lender notification to SBA of such advances is not required. (d) For loans processed under a Lender’s PLP authority, SBA does not consider the following to be refinancing SID: The debt is an interim loan that has been made for other than real estate construction purposes and was approved by the Lender within 90 days prior to the issuance of a PLP loan number; or The debt is a construction loan that has not been disbursed at the time the PLP loan number is issued. viii) Refinancing an SBA 504 loan.

Change of Ownership (13 CFR § 120.202). a) An Applicant may use International Trade loan proceeds for a change of ownership, whether the change of ownership is accomplished through a stock purchase or an asset purchase, only under the circumstances described in this paragraph. An asset purchase will be deemed a change of ownership and must comply with all of the requirements of this paragraph if the Applicant is purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of the seller’s business. The following requirements apply: i) The Applicant must purchase 100% of the ownership interest in another small business or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another small business through an asset purchase. ii) Regardless of whether the change of ownership is a stock purchase or an asset purchase, the Applicant must acquire from the seller facilities or equipment to be used in the United States in the production of goods or services involved in international trade and to develop and penetrate foreign markets. An SBA-guaranteed loan cannot be made solely to an individual. The small business must be either the Borrower or Co-Borrower. iii) The Applicant must be eligible for an International Trade loan. iv) The maximum 7(a) loan uses of proceeds for any change of ownership is capped at the business valuation amount. When the business valuation is lower than the sales agreement, any financed capital required to meet the shortfall (in addition to the 7(a) loan and any equity injection) must be subordinate to the 7(a) loan. v) Seller earnouts/buyer rebates: Seller earnouts are prohibited; however, buyer rebates based on business performance are allowed because this is a benefit to the Borrower. If the Borrower receives funds based on the rebate, it should first be applied to pay down the 7(a) loan to a point that will not trigger a subsidy recoupment fee, and any remaining funds may be used for business purposes; vi) The seller may not remain as an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of the Applicant. If a short transitional period is needed, the small business may contract with the seller as a consultant for a period not to exceed 12 months including any extensions. b) The Lender must comply with the requirements for IRS verification identified in Section A, Ch. 5, Para.

Maximum Guaranty Amounts and Percentages Except for International Trade and EWCP loans, the maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty to any one business (including affiliates) must not exceed $3,750,000. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. However, both International Trade and EWCP loans permit a maximum dollar amount outstanding of SBA’s guaranty of $4,500,000. When calculating the maximum guaranty percentage available to a Borrower and its affiliates, the Lender must include the approved loan amount for a revolving line of credit. The SBA’s guaranty is also known as the “SBA share” or “guaranteed portion.” i. The maximum guaranty amount is $4,500,000. ii.

General Policy on Interest Rates (13 CFR §§ 120.213 & 120.214): a) A loan may have a fixed or variable interest rate. The maximum interest rate that may be established for any IT loan is governed by SBA’s regulations on interest rates, which preempts any provisions of a state’s constitution or law. The Lender negotiates the interest rate with the Applicant, subject to SBA’s maximum allowable rates. b) SBA will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the Federal Register. The maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be the Prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month, plus an allowable spread over Prime, as set forth in the most recent Federal Register Notice . For a listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates, go to SBA’s FTA Wiki. The maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by a Lender if such rate will be in effect for", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_246_522213691", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Otherwise, the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply. c) For variable interest rate loans, the basis for the SBA maximum interest rate is an acceptable base rate plus allowable spread. The base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by SBA during that month. (Note: The date the “complete loan application is received by SBA” is the date the loan is approved and assigned an SBA loan number (for both delegated and non-delegated processing).) The initial note rate must not exceed SBA’s maximum interest rate. The spread above the base rate as identified in the Note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the Borrower. For further discussion of variable interest rates, see “Policy on Variable Interest Rates” below. d) Default interest rates are not permitted. e) For loans with a variable interest rate, the following terms must be defined in the Note: i) Base Rate and spread: (a) There are two acceptable base rates: The Prime Rate; or The SBA Optional Peg Rate. (b) The Prime Rate will be that rate which is in effect on the first business day of the month, as identified in a national financial newspaper or website. This rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month. If a website is used, please ensure whether it is publishing the current day’s rate or the previous day’s rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day’s rate. The Optional Peg Rate is a weighted average of rates the Federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average 7(a) loan. SBA calculates and publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register. Base Rates will be rounded to two decimal places with .004 being rounded down to .00 and .005 being rounded up to .01. ii) Frequency of change; iii) Range of fluctuation; and iv) Ceiling and floor (if any). f) After approval and prior to final disbursement, Lender must either notify the LGPC of any changes to the Note terms related to the interest rate or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. After final disbursement, Lender must either notify the appropriate Commercial Loan Servicing Center of any changes to the Note terms related to the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_247_788334382", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Base Rate, Allowable Spread, and Allowable Variance (13 CFR § 120.214) a) A loan may have a variable interest rate. The base rate may be one of the following: i) The Prime Rate; or ii) The SBA Optional Peg Rate. b) The allowable spread is based on the loan amount. i) Loans of $50,000 and less: Base rate + 6.5%; ii) Loans of $50,001 up to and including $250,000: Base rate + 6%; iii) Loans of $250,001 up to and including $350,000: Base rate + 4.5%; iv) Loans of $350,001 and higher: Base rate + 3%. c) The Lender must designate on its application for guaranty the amount of the percentage spread to be added to the base rate at each adjustment date. iii. Policy on Variable Interest Rates a) Standard Policy: SBA’s maximum allowable interest rate applies only to the initial Note rate on a variable rate loan. Subsequent changes in the base rate are not subject to the maximum rate at the time of loan application; however, the maximum spread over the base cannot exceed SBA’s stated maximum. b) Post-Approval Changes to the Interest Rate: i) Pre-Disbursement Changes: After loan approval and prior to first disbursement, the Lender may change the initial Note rate, including changing the base rate, the spread over the base rate, or change from a fixed rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, provided the new interest rate does not exceed the maximum allowable interest rate at the time of the loan application. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written consent to the change in the interest rate (separate and apart from executing the loan documents) and must either notify the LGPC of the change or make the change through E- Tran Servicing. For example, an SBA-guaranteed loan was approved with a variable rate. Since the loan was approved, the prime rate changed. The Borrower has asked the Lender if the loan can be switched to a fixed rate. If the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_248_67850844", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}
{"doc": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "page": 249, "text": "SOP 50 10 7.1 Section B, Ch 4: 7(a) Export Trade Finance: International Trade Effective November 15, 2023 Page 249 application, the Lender may make this change per the Borrower’s request. ii) Post-Disbursement Changes: After the loan is disbursed, on a variable rate loan, the Lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate as long as the new base rate or spread is based on a method permitted when the loan was approved and is consistent with the interest rate regulations at the time the loan was approved. The Lender must obtain the Borrower’s written agreement and must either notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of the change or make the change through E-Tran Servicing. For further guidance see SOP 50 57 . c) Frequency of Interest Rate Adjustment: i) The first adjustment may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month. Lenders may delay the initial adjustment period. For example, Lenders have used periods as long as 5 years in order to provide the Borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first 5 years of the loan. After that time, the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in E-Tran. ii) The Lender must specify in the Note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur. (a) This adjustment period as identified in the Note may not be changed without the written consent of the Borrower. (b) Subsequent adjustments may occur no more frequently than monthly. All subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period. (c) The rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period. For example, if the first of the month is a Sunday, the base rate is the prime rate in effect on Monday. This rate will be reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, the third calendar day and second business day of the month. Many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period, especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the Secondary Market. d) Interest Rate Requirements for an SBA Note: i) For fixed rate loans, the Lender must state the specific interest rate in the Note. ii) For variable rate loans, the Lender must include the following information in the Note: (a) Identification of the rate being used as the base rate;", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_249_664444865", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

For example, if the Note rate is 10% and the ceiling is 12%, the floor must be 8% or lower. f) Accrual Method: SBA does not require a specific accrual method, unless the loan is sold in the Secondary Market. Loans sold on the Secondary Market must either use 30/360 or Actual/365 as the interest accrual methods. While the interest accrual method 365/360 is permitted on loans not sold on the Secondary Market, Lenders are cautioned that they cannot use this accrual method and charge the maximum allowable rate of interest because this will result in an Annual Percentage Rate that exceeds SBA’s regulatory maximum. iv. Amortization: (13 CFR § 120.214(e) ): Lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan. SBA does not allow balloon payments. A fixed interest rate loan must use a payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. Typically, variable rate loans are re-amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date. The amortization schedule may also be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business. v. Fixed and Variable Rate Combinations: The Lender may use a fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and a variable rate on the other portion of the loan. SBA allows such combinations as long as neither rate exceeds the SBA maximum interest rate. A Lender may use this structure to make a loan that permits it to retain a", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_250_599433865", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

If the Lender uses a combination, the entire loan is considered to be a variable interest rate loan. The interest rate on both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions must be based on the variable rate. vi. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: a) An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties where one party pays a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount. The contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan. The swap contract only relates to the payment of interest. Example: A Borrower has a prime plus 2% interest rate on a 7(a) variable rate guaranteed loan. The Borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at 8%. When the Note rate is lower than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract (8%), the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk that rates will at some point exceed 8%. When the Note rate is higher than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract, the Borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of 8% and the swap seller would pay the difference above 8% to the Lender. The ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the Borrower of an interest rate swap contract. b) In order to use an interest rate swap in the 7(a) program, the interest rate swap contract must meet the following conditions: i) The interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business Borrower and the Lender or, if the swap seller is not the lender, a third party. SBA is not a party to the interest rate swap contract. ii) The interest rate swap contract does not affect the amount of money owed by the Borrower to SBA in the event SBA purchases the guaranty. In the event of a Borrower default, interest will be calculated using the base rate and spread in the variable interest rate Note, not the swap contract. iii) SBA will not be responsible if the swap seller defaults during the life of the contract. The Borrower will be liable for the interest as required in the Note. iv) Loans with accompanying interest rate swap contracts may be sold on the Secondary Market. The Lender is still required under the Secondary Market contract (SBA Form 1086) to forward interest and principal pursuant to the original terms of the loan. It is the Lender’s responsibility to work with the swap seller to make sure funds are available for submission to the fiscal and transfer agent according to the time schedule in the Form 1086.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_251_638327742", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

While swap contracts should not have a significant impact on the cost of the loan, SBA will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts. vii) The Borrower must sign a statement acknowledging that interest will be calculated at the Note rate if the swap contract is terminated. viii) The following statement must be included in the swap contract that is executed by the Borrower and the swap seller: “The Small Business Administration is not a party to this contract and does not guarantee it. In the event SBA is called upon to honor its guaranty to the Lender, the Borrower’s debt will be determined by the terms of the Note, including the variable interest rate provision.” ix) Swap contracts may be used on new or existing loans. x) The swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the loan agreement. xi) SBA does not have a standard form for an interest rate swap contract. xii) Any fees owed the swap counterparty as a result of the default by the Borrower will be subordinated to the SBA 7(a) loan. 4. Credit Standards for International Trade The policies that make up SBA’s credit standards begin with the requirements outlined in 13 CFR §§ 120.101 and 120.150 . This section provides procedural guidance as to what the Lender should or must consider when analyzing any request for financial assistance that will be guaranteed by SBA. A Lender must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment, not any expected recovery from the liquidation of collateral. Thus, if the Lender’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available or outside sources of repayment. a. Processing Methods Once submitted to the LGPC, an application withdrawn by a Lender, screened- out, or declined by the LGPC may not be approved by any Lender under its PLP authority. E-Tran will not permit the submission of such an application under any Lender’s PLP authority for a period of 12 months from the date of the withdrawal, screen-out, or decline of the application. i. Non-delegated – When a Lender submits an IT loan guaranty request under the non-delegated processing method, the Lender submits the application and supporting documents to SBA. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility and creditworthiness of the Applicant, including approving the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_252_196960532", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Delegated – When a Lender submits an IT loan guaranty request under the Lender’s PLP authority, the Agency does not review the Lender’s analysis of the credit or structure of the loan prior to issuing a loan number. The Lender must analyze credit worthiness in accordance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and properly document its file. The PLP Lender’s analysis is subject to SBA’s review and determination of adequacy, when the Lender requests SBA to purchase its guaranty or when SBA is conducting lender oversight activities. b. Underwriting i. Lender’s Credit Analysis: The Lender’s credit memorandum and analysis must address the Applicant’s ability and likelihood to repay the loan from the cash flow of the business and past performance by documenting the following: a) A description and history of the business, including: i) Nature of the business, including a description as to how the Applicant meets the specific Loan Program Requirements for an International Trade loan in paragraph C.1. above; ii) Length of time in business under current management; iii) Depth of management experience in the industry or a related industry; iv) Brief description of the business’s management team including principal’s involvement in the daily onsite management of the business or how the daily operations will be managed if the principals are not there on a daily basis. b) Financial analysis of repayment ability: i) For existing businesses based on the three most recent years of historical financial information (tax returns or balance sheet with debt schedule and income statement) plus an interim financial statement. (13 CFR § 120.191 ) ii) For new businesses, based on detailed projections, including the supporting assumptions which reflect positive cash flow within 2 years. iii) The financial analysis for all Applicants must address the following as applicable: (a) Historical cash flow for existing businesses that demonstrates total debt service coverage after the SBA loan; if the historical cash flow from the most recent full year and the interim financial statements do not show sufficient debt service coverage, Lender must obtain from the Applicant and analyze 2 years of detailed", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_253_975975422", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

(d) The effect any affiliates may have on the ultimate repayment ability of the Applicant. c) Debt Service (DS) is defined as the future required principal and interest payments on all business debt inclusive of new SBA loan proceeds. The Applicant’s debt service coverage ratio (OCF/DS) must be equal to or greater than 1.15 on a historical and/or projected cash flow basis and 1:1 on a global basis. To perform a complete analysis of debt service, it is important for a Lender to obtain a current debt schedule prepared by the Applicant, including any shareholder debt. d) For cash flow projections, the Lender must calculate the debt service coverage and provide the assumptions supporting the projected cash flow coverage, including as applicable: i) Justification for revenue growth, i.e., new product lines, sales channels, and new production facilities; ii) Justification for any reduction in expenses; and iii) A comparison to current industry trends. e) Spread of pro-forma Business Balance Sheet (current business balance sheet adjusted for all changes in assets and liabilities as a result of the SBA loan, other debt, any required equity injection and use of loan proceeds); f) Ratio calculations (based on the pro-forma Balance Sheet and historical and projected Income Statements) for the following financial ratio benchmarks: Current Ratio, Debt/Tangible Net Worth, Debt Service Coverage, and any other ratios the Lender considers significant for the business/ industry (e.g., inventory turnover, receivables turnover, and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_254_430771518", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

Equity requirements (13 CFR § 120.150): Except for transactions for changes in ownership, Lender’s requirement for equity and equity injection must be consistent with its requirements for similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. However, the Lender may use its discretion to reduce the amount of equity and/or equity injection required if it determines that the Applicant needs leverage that exceeds the Lender’s conventional requirements. a) Changes of Ownership Resulting in a new owner (complete change of ownership): At a minimum, SBA requires an equity injection of at least 10 percent of the total project costs, (all costs required to complete the change of ownership, regardless of the source of funds) for such transactions. i) Seller debt may not be considered as part of the equity injection unless either: (a) It is on full standby for the first 24 months of the 7(a) loan; or (b) A debt that is on partial standby (interest payments only being made) may be considered equity when there is historical business cash flow available to make the payments, and at least a quarter of the SBA-required equity injection is from a source other than the seller. Note: Equity injection is new cash or other acceptable assets added into the project that is not on the Applicant’s balance sheet prior to the equity injection.; ii) When an existing business starts or acquires a business that is in the same 6 digit NAICS code, with identical ownership, and in the same geographic area as the acquiring entity and they are co-borrowers, SBA considers this to be a business expansion, and SBA will not require a minimum equity injection. b) Source of Equity Injection: If the Lender or SBA requires an equity injection, the Lender must use the same processes to verify the equity injection as it uses for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. c. Collateral See Section A, Ch. 5, Para. A. for guaranty requirements. i. The Small Business Act, Section 7(a)(16)(B), prohibits SBA from waiving collateral below a certain loan size amount. The Lender must take a first lien on the assets financed with IT loan proceeds or other assets of the Applicant. An IT loan can be secured by a second lien position on the property or equipment financed by the IT loan or on other assets of the Applicant, if the SBA determines that the second lien provides adequate assurance of repayment of the loan.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_256_372272241", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

SBA considers “at or about the same time” to mean loans approved within 90 days of each other. b) The Lender’s analysis identifies how the risk of a second lien position on the IT loan is offset by other factors, such as other collateral has been taken to secure the IT loan that in liquidation would pay the IT loan in full or the business has been operating profitably and repaying its existing obligations in a timely manner and the Borrower’s cash flow is sufficient to repay all of the Borrower’s debt, including the IT loan. c) Clear justification must exist when the interest rate for the first lien loan is significantly higher than the IT loan and/or the maturity of the first lien loan is significantly shorter than the IT loan. ii. IT loans may not be processed under a Lender’s PLP authority when the IT loan will not have a first lien on the assets being financed. iii.

Real Estate Appraisal and Business Valuation Requirements The regulation governing real estate appraisal is set forth at 13 CFR § 120.160(b) . i. Commercial Real Estate: a) For all loans secured by commercial real when the loan proceeds will be used to acquire, refinance, or improve real estate, Lenders must obtain an appraisal by a State licensed or certified appraiser. Appraisals must be in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Additionally, SBA requires that completed appraisals be dated within 12 months of the application for guaranty. For federally-regulated Lenders, no exemption is granted under the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines dated December 2, 2010 for Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency. b) The appraiser must be: i) Independent and have no appearance of a conflict of interest (such as a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the property or transaction, independent of the loan production function, and not involved in the approval of the transaction); and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_257_228403716", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}

The Lender may not use an appraisal prepared for the seller or the Applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Applicant. d) The appraisal must be an “Appraisal Report” prepared in compliance with USPAP. e) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.) After construction is completed, Lender must obtain a statement from the appraiser, general contractor, project architect, or construction management firm that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based. If the Lender cannot obtain such a statement, then the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission. f) If the SBA-guaranteed loan was used to cover the construction period, the Lender must notify the appropriate SBA CLSC of any deviation(s) and work with the SBA CLSC to determine an appropriate course of action, including the securing of additional collateral. The Lender’s notification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. If the Lender is unable to obtain a statement that the building was built with only minor deviations (if any) from the plans and specifications upon which the original estimate of value was based, but is able to obtain a new appraisal demonstrating that the market value meets or exceeds the original estimate of value, then no additional action on the part of the Lender is necessary. g) If the loan will be used to acquire an existing building that does not require construction, the appraiser should estimate market value on an as-is basis.

In no case may the Lender rely on an appraisal that was prepared more than 12 months prior to the date of the application. j) If the Lender is going to require the appraisal at closing, the loan application must include an estimate of the value of the real estate and the estimate must be identified in the Lender’s credit memorandum with the requirement for an appraisal that supports the estimated value at time of closing. k) If at time of closing the appraised value: i) Is 90% or more of the estimated value, the Lender may close the loan but must include a written explanation as to why the appraisal is less than the estimated value in the loan file; or ii) Is less than 90% of estimated value, the Lender may not close the loan without SBA’s prior written permission (see exception below for PLP Lenders). The Lender’s justification to SBA must provide a sufficient understanding of the reasons for the differences in values between the estimated and actual values as well as a recommendation as to a remedy to offset the difference in values such as additional equity or additional collateral. If additional collateral is being required, the Lender must identify both the fair market and liquidation values of the additional collateral. iii) Exception for PLP Lenders: PLP Lenders are permitted to close a loan when the appraisal is less than 90% of the estimated value but the Lender must include a written justification as part of its file that may be reviewed by SBA at time of guaranty purchase or when SBA is reviewing the Lender. The justification must include a thorough analysis by the Lender of the reasons for the appraisal being low and an explanation as to what steps the Lender took to offset the risk to SBA from the low appraisal such as additional equity or additional collateral. ii.

The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. A valuation of the fixed assets provided as part of a business valuation will not meet these requirements, except as part of a going concern appraisal. iv. Additional Appraisal Requirements for all Changes of Ownership: For businesses that have been transferred within 36 months prior to the date of the loan application and the loan amount is more than $500,000, SBA requires: a) An appraisal of the business real estate that meets the appraisal requirements above; and b) Either a review of the appraisal by another appraiser selected directly by the Lender or a site visit by a senior member of the Lender’s staff. The Lender must document the file and include the date of the visit and a description of the items reviewed on site. v. Business Valuation Requirements – Change of Ownership: a) Determining the value of a business (not including real estate which is separately valued through a real estate appraisal) is the key component to the analysis of any loan application for a change of ownership. An accurate business valuation is required because the change in ownership will result in new debt and potentially the creation of intangible assets. A business valuation assists the buyer in making a determination that the seller’s asking price is supported by an independent Qualified Source (see definition in Appendix 3). b) In order for the individual performing the business valuation to identify the scope of work appropriately, the business valuation must be requested by and prepared for the Lender. The scope of work should identify whether the transaction is an asset purchase or stock purchase and be specific enough for the individual performing the business valuation to know what is included in the sale (including any assumed debt). The business valuation must include the individual’s conclusion of value, the qualifications of the individual performing the business valuation and their signature certifying to the information contained in the business valuation. The Lender may not use a business valuation prepared for the Applicant or the seller. The cost of the business valuation may be passed on to the Applicant. i) Non-Special Purpose Properties: (a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_260_827752973", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

(a) If the amount being financed (including any 7(a), 504, seller, or other financing) minus the appraised value of real estate and/or equipment being financed is $250,000 or less, the Lender may perform its own valuation of the business being sold, unless the Lender’s internal policies and procedures require an independent business valuation from a Qualified Source.

The appraiser must be independent of the loan production function, not involved in the approval of the transaction, and must not have the appearance of a conflict of interest. (c) The appraisal must allocate separate values to the individual components of the transaction including land, building, equipment, and intangible assets.

(See paragraph 5 below.) iv) If the application will be submitted under delegated authority, the business valuation may be obtained and reviewed after the issuance of an SBA Loan Number and prior to closing. If the Lender is processing the application under delegated authority and requests the business valuation after issuance of an SBA Loan Number, the credit memorandum must include an estimate of the value of the business. The credit memorandum must be updated after receipt of the business valuation to include a comparison of the loan amount and the business valuation. v) Any amount(s) of the loan proceeds that will be used to facilitate a change of ownership may not exceed the business valuation. vi) Lender Verification of Business valuation Financial Data: Lender must obtain a copy of the financial information relied upon by the individual who performed the business valuation and verify that information against the seller’s IRS transcripts to ensure the accuracy of the information. 5. Submission of Application for Guaranty for International Trade a. Contents of Lender’s Application for Guaranty The contents of the Lender’s application for guaranty vary depending on the method of processing chosen by the Lender, but in all cases must maintain those documents and any that support the guaranty request in their loan files. Lender must list in E-Tran all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant, and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant. SBA Form 1919 includes information on the number of existing employees at the time of application and the number of jobs to be created and/or retained as a result of the loan. • Number of existing employees at the time of application is calculated in accordance with 13 CFR § 121.106 , which states in part that SBA counts all individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis (i.e., jobs are not converted to full-time equivalents). • Jobs “created” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees that the small business expects to hire as a result of the loan. • Jobs “retained” means the number of full-time (or equivalent) employees on the payroll of the business at the time of application that will be lost if the loan is not approved. • “Employees” does not include contractors reported via IRS Form 1099. i.

E-TRAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS (FORMERLY “AUTHORIZATION”) The Lender’s executed SBA Form 750 is the written agreement between the SBA and the Lender requiring the Lender to comply with all SBA Loan Program Requirements as defined in 13 CFR 120.10, including but not limited to, the applicable statute, regulations, and SOP guidance, and allowing the Lender to make loans with an SBA guaranty when authorized by SBA. The E-Tran loan guaranty authorization request is the digital request by the Lender to SBA to authorize the Lender to make the loan with an SBA guaranty under the terms and conditions submitted in E-Tran. SBA’s guaranty is subject to the terms and conditions authorized by SBA in E-Tran (including any changes) and the Lender’s compliance with those terms and conditions and all other applicable SBA Loan Program Requirements. Unless otherwise required by SBA (e.g., OCRM), the Lender should not send SBA any other loan closing documentation, including disbursement information, except through the required periodic loan status reports using SBA Form 1502. See SOP 50 57 for directions on servicing and liquidating loans. SBA does not require signatures on the terms and conditions. The terms and conditions are electronically stored in E-Tran. 1. For loans processed using a Lender’s delegated authority (PLP, PLP-EWCP, SBA Express, or Export Express), the Lender submits the loan guaranty request with the loan terms and conditions in E-Tran. The SBA loan number will be issued in E-Tran. 2. For non-delegated loans processed through LGPC, the Lender submits the loan guaranty request by submitting the loan terms and conditions in E-Tran. SBA will review the application and issue the SBA loan number if the loan is approved. 3.

The delegated Lender also is responsible for confirming that all loan closing decisions are correct, and that it has complied with all SBA Loan Program Requirements. b) Submit requests for an increase or decrease in guaranty percentage for approval. Regardless of processing method (non-delegated or delegated): Lenders must inform SBA of certain actions by making the appropriate change using E-Tran Servicing. When the Lender makes the change using E-Tran Servicing, a separate notification to the appropriate SBA center is not necessary (SBA approval of these items is not necessary, and SBA will not respond in writing). These actions include the following: i. Cancellation of the entire loan; ii. Partial cancellation of loan (Lenders, via E-Tran, should change the “Approval Amount” box to reflect the revised loan amount. Do not change the “Original Approval Amount.”); iii. Change in the loan maturity date; iv. Change in the legal name or trade name of the business; v. Change in the Borrower/obligor’s business address; vi. Change in interest rate prior to initial disbursement; vii. Cancel SBA Guaranty prior to initial disbursement; or viii. Cancel SBA Guaranty after initial disbursement. 2. For SBA loans that have been fully disbursed: Lenders must refer to SOP 50 57 , 7(a) Loan Servicing and Liquidation to determine if notification or prior approval from SBA is required. All loan increases, regardless of disbursement status, are subject to statutory, administrative, and program maximums and must be approved by SBA. 3. Loan Increases: Increases to 7(a) loans, regardless of the disbursement status, are subject to statutory, administrative, and program maximums and must be approved by SBA. Upfront and ongoing fees for increases in subsequent years are at the rates in effect at the time the loan was originally approved. If any requested increase to a 7(a) Small Loan results in a total loan(s) in excess of $500,000 (including loans made within 90 days of another), the Lender must follow the underwriting procedures for Standard 7(a) Loans as outlined in Chapter 1, Para.

For delegated loans, the Lender must document the same analysis and retain it in Lender’s loan file. Revolving lines of credit increases may be requested: i. If made under SBA Express and Export Express: a) At any time during the life of the loan, but must be within 5 years for SBA Express and 7 years for Export Express of the date of loan approval and be in compliance with the maximum maturities on SBA Express and Export Express loans; b) Must include an analysis of appropriate credit and risk factors consistent with the procedures the Lender uses for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans if the increase is above 33% of the original loan amount. ii. If made under CAPLines: a) At any time during the life of the loan, but must be within 10 years of the date of loan approval (except Builder’s CAPLines which must be within 5 years of the date of loan approval) and be in compliance with maximum maturities on CAPLines; b) If the request for an increase is more than 20% of the original loan amount or is more than18 months after the original approval date of the loan, the Lender must include with its request its analysis showing that the purpose of the increase is the same as the original purpose of the loan and that the Borrower’s cash flow can support the increased payment amount. iii.

Approval of the requested increase in E-Tran will constitute SBA’s prior written consent. SBA may review the documentation supporting the increase when conducting lender oversight activities and at time of guaranty purchase. C. TRANSFER OF GUARANTY BETWEEN PARTICIPATING LENDERS 1.

To transfer the guaranty on more than one loan prior to final disbursement, Lender must submit a written explanation to the LGPC along with any supporting documentation. The LGPC will forward the request to the D/FA or designee for a decision. D. LOAN CLOSING AND DISBURSEMENT The following instructions for loan closing and disbursement pertain to all 7(a) loans. 1. Disbursement Period: The loan must be fully disbursed within 48 months of approval or any remaining undisbursed balance will be cancelled by SBA. SBA considers a revolving line of credit as fully disbursed at the time of first disbursement. Lenders may use an escrow account for not more than 5 business days to facilitate a loan closing. A Lender must not report the loan on SBA Form 1502 as “disbursed” or charge the Borrower the guaranty fee until all funds are disbursed from the escrow account. The Lender may only charge the Borrower interest on funds that have been disbursed out of escrow to the Borrower. A loan is considered to be fully disbursed and then may be sold on the Secondary Market when the Borrower has access to all of the loan proceeds and is able to use them in accordance with the authorization. 2. Note Terms: Note terms must include: All interest rate requirements including, if applicable, any interest-only payment period. The date of initial adjustment and the frequency of subsequent adjustments; Maturity date. Loans with a maturity of 15 years or more must contain prepayment/subsidy recoupment fee payable to SBA in accordance with 13 CFR § 120.223. Repayment terms for CAPLine Loans: i. Interest only payments for any period exceeding the Borrower’s cash cycle, seasonal cycle, contract final payment date, or project completion date are not permitted. ii. Master Notes and Sub-Notes: Each loan will have a Master Note to cover the total loan amount and general repayment period. Lenders can also use a system of sub-notes to establish specific repayment periods for particular seasons, contract, or construction/renovation project. When the CAPLine will be used to finance the creation of more than one asset (such as the completion of two contracts) sub-notes should be used. The conditions of the sub-notes must not conflict with the conditions of the Master Note, except for variances in repayment schedules.

The account must be FDIC-insured and pay the Borrower a money market rate of interest, or the rate typically paid on escrow accounts for commercial real property on non-SBA guaranteed loans, whichever is greater; iv. Except for those items covered in subparagraphs g.ii and iii immediately above, the account must be consistent with accounts required of the Lender’s conventional Borrowers and the Lender must use similar procedures to administer the escrow accounts on its SBA loans as it does for its non-SBA guaranteed loans (SBLCs must be consistent with the practices followed by federally-regulated Financial Institutions); v. Lender must remit to the Borrower all accrued interest on the account and provide annual statements, unless otherwise required by state or Federal law; and vi. Upon termination of the account, the remaining funds must be returned to the Borrower within 15 business days. For loans being sold on the secondary market, in addition to the above: i.

With regards to Borrower payment application: Lender will apply each installment payment first to pay interest accrued to the day Lender receives the payment, then to bring principal current, then to pay any late fees, and will apply any remaining balance to reduce principal. xi. Language covering prepayment: Notwithstanding any provision in this Note to the contrary, Borrower may prepay this Note. Borrower may prepay 20% or less of the unpaid principal balance at any time without notice. If Borrower prepays more than 20% and the Loan has been sold on the secondary market, Borrower must: a. Give Lender written notice; b. Pay all accrued interest; and c. If the prepayment is received less than 21 days from the date Lender receives the notice, pay an amount equal to 21 days' interest from the date lender receives the notice, less any interest accrued during the 21 days and paid under b., above. If Borrower does not prepay within 30 days from the date Lender receives the notice, Borrower must give Lender a new notice. xii. Subsidy Recoupment Fee language, if applicable: When in any one of the first three years following the date of first disbursement Borrower voluntarily prepays more than 25% of the outstanding principal balance of the loan, Borrower must pay to lender on behalf of SBA a prepayment fee for that year as follows: a. During the first year after the date of first disbursement, 5% of the total prepayment amount; b. During the second year after the date of first disbursement, 3% of the total prepayment amount; c. During the third year after the date of first disbursement, 1% of the total prepayment amount. 3. Closing Documentation: For all 7(a) loans, Lender must document each disbursement consistent with their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. If a Lender or SBA requires an equity injection and, as part of its standard processes for its similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, the Lender verifies the equity injection, it must do so for its SBA loan. 4. Required SBA Forms: For all 7(a) loans, Lenders have the option of using their own Note and guaranty agreements or the SBA versions (SBA Forms 147, 148 and 148L). i. If the Lender uses its own Note form, the Lender must ensure that the Note is legally enforceable and assignable, has a stated maturity and is not payable on demand.

Lenders that intend to sell the loan guarantee into the SBA Secondary Market are strongly encouraged to use the SBA Form 147. If a Lender uses its own form of a note, all terms and conditions in the SBA Form 147 must be included in the document. The Fiscal Transfer Agent reviews notes other than the SBA Form 147 to ensure that all required terms and conditions for sale are satisfied, which may increase processing time for loan sales settlement. iii.

The loan may not be sold into the secondary market until all required licenses are obtained. 7. Required Lender Action: In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Lenders are required to report information to the appropriate credit reporting agencies whenever they extend credit via an SBA loan. Thereafter, the Lender should continue to routinely report information concerning servicing, liquidation, and charge off activities throughout the life cycle of the loan, as specified in SOP 50 57 or a successor procedural guide. 8.

Job Opportunity is defined in Appendix 3, Definitions. A Job Opportunity does not have to be at the project facility, but 75% of the jobs must be in the community where the project is located. Job Retention may only be used if the CDC can reasonably show that jobs would be lost to the community if the project was not done. CDCs must list estimated jobs created or retained at the time of application and in its Annual Report.

Renewable energy sources that generate more than 15% of energy used at Project Facility. a) This category includes plant, equipment, and process upgrades of renewable energy sources such as the small-scale production of energy for individual buildings or communities’ consumption, commonly known as micropower, or renewable fuel producers including biodiesel and ethanol producers. b) Each Project must generate more than 15% of the energy used by the Applicant at the Project facility. In addition, all improvements or equipment required to generate the renewable energy or renewable fuels must be included in the 504 Project costs; or iii. Increased use of sustainable designs. Increased use of sustainable designs, including designs that reduce the use of greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels or low-impact design to produce buildings that reduce the use of non- renewable resources and minimize environmental impact. iv. With respect to paragraphs i. and ii. above, the Applicant must document the Energy Public Policy Project’s compliance through either an energy audit, engineering report, or other professional evaluation, as deemed appropriate by SBA, that is based on the annual energy usage at the facility or facilities (measured in actual energy usage, e.g. kilowatt hours, therms, or gallons, as applicable, not in dollar costs), and that, at a minimum, includes the following:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_284_190224402", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

No more than 50% of eligible Project costs can be from Federal sources (13 CFR § 120.930(a)). 1. Third Party Loan 13 CFR § 120.920 The Third Party Lender must be in place at the time of application and must be evidenced by a letter of intent/term sheet or commitment letter included in the application package outlining the terms and conditions of the Interim and/or Third Party Loan to enable SBA to evaluate the 504 application. The terms of the Third Party Loan are defined in 13 CFR § 120.921. The Third Party Loan must be at least as much as the net debenture proceeds. However, the Third Party Loan must total at least 50% of the Project costs if the Borrower (or Operating Company if the Borrower is an Eligible Passive Company) has operated for 2 years or less or the Project is for the acquisition, construction, conversion or expansion of a limited or single purpose asset. The Third Party Loan may be closed and begin amortizing prior to the debenture funding as long as the Third Party Lender obtains the Borrower’s written consent. The Third Party Lender’s note and loan documents must not have any cross- default, “deem-at-risk,” or any other provisions which allow the Third Party Lender to make demand prior to maturity unless the loan is in default. The 504 loan is usually collateralized by a second lien on Project Property. The Third Party Lender may obtain additional collateral or other security for the Third Party Loan in addition to its lien on the Project Property (“Additional Collateral”) only if in the event of liquidation and unless otherwise approved in writing by the D/OFPO: i. The Third Party Lender liquidates or otherwise exhausts all reasonable avenues of collection with respect to the Additional Collateral no later than the disposition of the Project Property, and ii. The Third Party Lender applies any proceeds received as a result of the Additional Collateral to the balance outstanding on the Third Party Loan prior to the application of proceeds from the disposition of the Project Property to the Third Party Loan. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: i. An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties where one party pays a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount. The contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan. The swap contract only relates to the payment of interest. Example: A Borrower has a prime plus 2% interest rate on a Third Party Loan variable rate loan (presently 5.25%). The Borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at 7%. When the Note rate is lower than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract (7%), the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_286_179507161", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

When the Note rate is higher than the rate paid by the Borrower on the swap contract, the Borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of 7% and the swap seller would pay the difference above 7% to the lender. The ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the Borrower of an interest rate swap contract. ii. Third Party Loans may use swap contracts. In order to use an interest rate swap on a Third Party Loan, the interest rate swap contract must meet the following conditions: a) The interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business Borrower and the lender or, if the swap seller is not the lender, a third party. SBA is not a party to the interest rate swap contract. b) SBA will not review swap contracts for Borrowers or provide guidance on their use. While swap contracts should not have a significant impact on the cost of the loan, SBA will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts. c) Swap contracts may be used on new or existing Third Party Loans. d) The swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the Third Party Loan. e) SBA does not have a standard form for an interest rate swap contract. f) Any fees owed the swap counterparty as a result of the default by the Borrower will be subordinated to the SBA 504 loan. CDCs must not enter into any Intercreditor agreement with the Third Party Lender other than SBA Form 2287, “Third Party Lender Agreement,” without the prior written consent of SBA. 2. Interim Financing Loans under the 504 program provide permanent or take-out financing (see Chapter 2, Para. C.2. Escrow Closing , below in this Section, for the requirements of an escrow closing with no interim loan). An interim lender (either the Third Party Lender or another lender) provides the interim financing to cover the period between SBA approval of the project and the debenture sale. After the project is completed, the CDC will close the 504 loan. The proceeds from the Debenture sale repay the interim lender for the amount of the 504 project costs that it advanced on an interim basis. Any experienced, independent source including the Third Party Lender may supply interim financing provided they meet the conditions described in 13 CFR § 120.890. A CDC may provide interim financing but only for a project financed by another CDC. As stated in the regulation, neither the Borrower nor an Associate of the Borrower may supply interim financing. If the Third Party Lender provides the interim loan, it may do so using: i. An interim note which will be paid in full with the net debenture proceeds and a permanent note; or", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_287_29886488", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

A single note, which includes both the interim and permanent financing that will be reduced by the net debenture proceeds. Example of Interim Financing of Eligible Project Costs Expenses Incurred Prior to the 504 Application: Purchase of Land (Principal portion of short-term financing) $180,000 Equity in Land 20,000 Purchase of M & E 100,000 Cost estimates submitted at time of application: Construction of Building 600,000 Total Project Costs Permanent Financing Structure: 900,000 First Mortgage Lender 50% 450,000 504 Net Proceeds 40% $360,000 Borrower Equity 10% $90,000 Total Financing 100% $900,000 In this example the interim loan would be $810,000. The Borrower cannot be reimbursed directly from the net debenture proceeds, but the lender can refinance these with an interim loan at any time prior to the loan closing. 3. Financing Involving Industrial Development Bonds or Industrial Revenue Bonds SBA may participate in Projects financed in part, directly or indirectly, by obligations exempt from state or local taxes (for example, real estate tax exemptions). However, in accordance with OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non- Tax Receivables” (January 2013), SBA may not participate in projects financed in part, directly or indirectly, by Federal tax-exempt obligations. For Projects that do not involve Federal tax-exempt obligations, industrial development bonds or industrial revenue bonds (IDBs/IRBs) may be a source of funding for Projects under the following conditions: When the bond proceeds are used to fund the Third Party Loan: i. If the bond issuer requires that it hold title to the Project Property, the TPL’s and SBA’s respective liens must be properly recorded before any transfer of the title to the Project Property to the bond issuer; ii. If the bond issuer takes title to the Project Property and leases the Project Property to the Borrower, the bond issuer must assign the lease to the Third Party Lender and all payments under the lease must be paid to the Third Party Lender and serve as the payments under the loan; iii. If subparagraphs a.i. and a.ii. are met, then the Third Party Loan may remain in a senior lien position.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_288_449211036", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

If the bond issuer does not require that it hold title to the Project Property but takes a lien on the Project Property, the Third Party Lender may still be in a senior lien position, but SBA’s lien position must not be subordinate to the bond issuer’s lien. When the bond proceeds are used to fund the Borrower’s Contribution: i. If the bond issuer requires that it hold title to the Project Property, the TPL’s and SBA’s respective liens must be properly recorded before any transfer of the title to the Project Property to the bond issuer; ii. SBA’s lien position must not be subordinate to the bond issuer’s lien; and iii. The Borrower may not pay the loan made from the proceeds of the tax- exempt obligation at a faster rate than the 504 loan unless it is approved by the D/FA or designee; In no case may a default in payment of the tax-exempt obligation result in a tax lien on the property; and In transactions where the bond issuer takes collateral other than the Project Property, SBA may, in its discretion, agree to take a subordinate lien position on that collateral. The structure of these transactions may vary from state to state and other conditions may apply. 4. Financing Involving Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits Under IRS regulations (Internal Revenue Code § 50), the owner of property eligible for historic rehabilitation tax credits may lease the property, and transfer the historic rehabilitation tax credits, to another party (the “Tax Credit Investor”). SBA may participate in Projects involving such tax credits under the following conditions: In such situations where the Borrower is the owner of the property eligible for the historic rehabilitation tax credits, the Project Property may be leased by the Borrower to the Tax Credit Investor and then must be simultaneously subleased back from the Tax Credit Investor to the Borrower. The term of the sublease must be equal to the term of the lease. The transfer of the rehabilitation tax credits from the Borrower to the Tax Credit Investor must comply with all applicable IRS requirements. Copies of the lease and the sublease that will be executed by the Borrower and the Tax Credit Investor must be submitted with the 504 application. The executed copies of both leases must be submitted for review (including legal review by SBA counsel) prior to closing. This review will be limited to ensuring that the terms of the two leases are equal. SBA’s lien on the Project Property must not be subordinate to the lease between the Borrower and the Tax Credit Investor. The loan may not be structured as an EPC/OC loan.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_289_670107419", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

SBA may also participate in projects where the Borrower transfers State rehabilitation tax credits if such projects satisfy all applicable State requirements and the other requirements set forth above. C. ELIGIBLE USES OF PROCEEDS 13 CFR §§ 120.882 – 120.884 CDCs must always start by reviewing the contents of Section A, Core Requirements for all 7(a) and 504 Loans. When a 504 Borrower is an exporter engaging in export transactions (including indirect exports) or when the Borrower has or will have foreign accounts receivable, the CDC must determine if U.S. companies are authorized to conduct business with the Parties and the country(ies) to which the goods or services will be shipped. CDCs must check Ex-Im Bank’s Country Limitation Schedule, which can be found on Ex-Im Bank’s website at www.exim.gov/tools-for- exporters/country-limitation-schedule or is available from SBA’s Office of International Trade. The CDC also must check the Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists, which can be found at sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/. A 504 loan may not be made to a business that directly or indirectly exports to a foreign country which is listed as a prohibited country (Note # 7 on the Country Limitation Schedule), or if the transaction would be prohibited under any of the sanctions programs administered by OFAC. 1. Land and Necessary Land Improvements (For example, grading, new streets including curbs and gutters, parking lots, utilities, and landscaping.) No matter how long the land has been owned, the value of the land: Will be based on cost only if it was purchased less than 2 years prior to the date of the application; and Will be based on the fair market value of the land as determined by an independent real estate appraisal that meets the requirements in paragraph E.2.b, Appraisals, below if the land has been held for 2 years or more; May include the costs of building and building improvements such as facade expenditures, heating, electrical, plumbing and roofing costs. The value of the land also may include the costs of solar panels and associated equipment and installation costs unless: i. The primary purpose of the solar panels is to produce electricity for sale (i.e., solar farms), in which case the panels are treated as machinery and equipment; or ii. The solar panels are part of a system that is leased to the Borrower and owned by a third party, and ownership of these assets will not transfer to the Borrower at the end of the lease. 2.

Permissible Debt Refinance without Expansion 13 CFR § 120.882(g) SBA may approve a Refinancing Project of a Qualified Debt that does not involve an expansion as follows: Definitions i. “Qualified Debt” means a commercial loan that: a) Either: i) Substantially all (75% or more) of the proceeds of the existing debt was used to acquire an Eligible Fixed Asset(s) and the remaining amount (25% or less) was incurred for the benefit of the small business seeking refinancing; or ii) If the Eligible Fixed Asset(s) was originally financed through a commercial loan (hereafter the “original loan”) that was subsequently refinanced one or more times: (a) Substantially all (75% or more) of the proceeds of the original loan was used to acquire an Eligible Fixed Asset(s) and the remaining amount (25% or less) was incurred for the benefit of the small business seeking the refinancing; and (b) The existing debt is the most recent refinancing of the original loan. b) Was incurred not less than 6 months prior to the date of application. c) Was incurred for the benefit of the small business that is seeking the refinancing. d) Has been secured by Eligible Fixed Asset(s) for at least 6 months. e) May include debt subject to a federal guarantee under these conditions: i) An existing 504 loan if both the Third Party Loan and the 504 loan are being refinanced or the Third Party Loan has been paid in full, and ii) The CDC has notified the existing CDC or 7(a) Lender in writing by letter or email no less than 10 business days to advise them the existing loan is being refinanced.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_292_724485732", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

In calculating the percentage reduction in the new installment payment, prepayment penalties, 7(a) subsidy recoupment fees, financing fees, and other financing costs, must be added to the amount being refinanced, but not Eligible Business Expenses. The CDC may request the D/FA or designee to approve an exception to the 10 percent reduction requirement for good cause. PCLP CDCs may not use their delegated authority to approve a loan requiring this exception. iv) If the loan being refinanced is guaranteed by a Federal agency other than SBA, the CDC must document in writing that the refinancing of the Federally-guaranteed loan is permissible under the other Federal agency’s requirements or is otherwise approved by the other Federal agency. f) If the CDC can demonstrate that the commercial real estate provides adequate collateral protection for the SBA, any liens on machinery and equipment purchased with proceeds of the original loan can be waived.

If the Qualified Debt (including the original loan as defined in paragraph C.10.a.i.a)ii) above) was for the construction of a new building, or the acquisition, renovation, or reconstruction of an existing building, and such loan would not have satisfied the leasing policies set forth in 13 CFR §§ 120.131 and 120,870(b), Borrower must be able to demonstrate compliance with 13 CFR 120.131(b) for existing buildings as of the date of application for assistance. When the Refinancing Project involves a Limited or Special Purpose Property (see the Limited or Special Purpose Property List at paragraph E.1.c.i.c) below), the Borrower must comply with the Borrower contribution requirements in paragraph E.1.c, below. Notwithstanding § 120.860, a debt may be refinanced under this paragraph 10 if the Refinancing Project does not meet the job creation or other economic development objectives set forth in § 120.861 or § 120.862. In such case, the 504 loan may not exceed the product obtained by multiplying the number of employees of the Borrower by $90,000. The number of employees of the Borrower is equal to the sum of: i. The number of full-time employees of the Borrower on the date of the application, and ii. The product obtained by multiplying: a) The number of part-time employees of the Borrower on the date of the application; by b) The quotient obtained by dividing the average number of hours each part time employee of the Borrower works each week by 40.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_295_48783338", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The maximum amount of the 504 loan would be 47.5 multiplied by $90,000, or $4,275,000. Loan-to-Value Limitations i. For projects that refinance only Qualified Debt, the maximum loan to value of the Refinancing Project allowed is 90%. ii. For projects when the amount of Qualified Debt being refinanced is more than 90 percent of the value of the Eligible Fixed Asset(s) securing the Qualified Debt, the Borrower must provide additional cash or other fixed asset collateral acceptable to SBA so as not to exceed a 90% loan to value of the Refinancing Project. iii. For any projects that include the financing of Eligible Business Expenses, a maximum 90% loan to value of the Refinancing Project will apply. The value of the Refinancing Project may not be increased by adding additional collateral. Fees i. In addition to the annual guarantee fee assessed under 13 CFR § 120.971(d)(2) , Borrower must pay SBA a supplemental annual guarantee fee to cover any additional cost attributable to the refinancing in an amount established by SBA each fiscal year. The CDC should follow the instructions in the SBA-issued E-Tran terms and conditions to ensure the fee is correct. ii. SBA will review the fee annually to determine whether it needs to be changed and, if so, will issue a notice of any change. Other Implementation Guidelines i. Borrower must meet all current 504 Loan Program occupancy requirements at time of application. ii. PCLP CDCs may not approve, under their delegated authority, the refinancing of an existing loan of the PCLP CDC, or its affiliates (i.e., Same Institution Debt) and must submit the 504 loan to SBA for approval. This requirement is consistent with SBA’s long-standing policy of prohibiting its participating lenders from using their delegated authority to approve the financing of same institution debt due to the potential conflict of interest and the risk of the 504 loan proceeds being used to shift to SBA a potential loss from the existing debt. iii. Loans for Debt Refinance without Expansion must be disbursed within 9 months after loan approval.

The debt being refinanced will be added to the expansion cost to establish the total project costs, if all the conditions discussed below are met. A “Project involves Expansion” if it involves the acquisition, construction, or improvement of land, building or equipment for use by the Applicant. The CDC must provide an analysis in its credit memorandum that the proposed debt refinancing satisfies each of the requirements below: i. Either: a) Substantially all (85% or more) of the proceeds of the existing debt was used to acquire a fixed asset(s) that was eligible for financing under the 504 loan program and the remaining amount (15% or less) was incurred for the benefit of the small business seeking refinancing; or b) If the fixed asset(s) was originally financed through a commercial loan (hereafter the “original loan”) that was subsequently refinanced one or more times: i) Substantially all (85% or more) of the proceeds of the original loan was used to acquire the fixed asset(s) and the remaining amount (15% or less) was incurred for the benefit of the small business seeking the refinancing; and ii) The existing debt is the most recent refinancing of the original loan. ii.

PCLP CDCs may not use their delegated authority to approve a loan requiring this waiver. The lender of the existing indebtedness must release, subordinate (if the total existing indebtedness is not being refinanced) or assign its lien on the 504 eligible fixed assets to the lien of SBA and/or the Third Party Lender so that the Third Party Lender and/or SBA will maintain the same lien position on the collateral that was held by the lender whose debt is being refinanced. iv. The existing indebtedness was incurred for the benefit of the small business concern. a) The small business for which the debt is being refinanced must be the same small business for which any new Project costs are incurred. The debts being refinanced may be owed by an Operating Company, an Eligible Passive Company or both. b) An existing 504 loan may be refinanced if it meets the conditions of this paragraph and either: both the Third Party Loan and the 504 loan are being refinanced; or the Third Party Loan has been paid in full and the 504 loan needs to be refinanced as part of a larger transaction to provide funding for expansion or renovations to the Project Property. In either case, the CDC and Third Party Lender must document its loan file as to the justification to refinance the existing SBA-guaranteed 504 loan. Any applicable 504 prepayment penalties will apply. A Third Party Loan may not be refinanced with an SBA-guaranteed loan. ( 13 CFR § 120.920(b)) c) An existing 7(a) loan may be refinanced in whole or in part only if the CDC has provided verification that the present lender is either unwilling or unable to modify the current payment schedule. In the case of Same Institution Debt, if the Third Party Lender or the CDC affiliate as authorized under 13 CFR § 120.820 is the 7(a) lender, the loan will be eligible for 504 refinancing only if the lender is unable to modify the terms of the existing loan because a Secondary Market investor will not agree to modified terms. v. The financing will be used only for refinancing existing indebtedness or costs relating to the Project financed. a) Debt being refinanced does not need to be for assets at the same location or for the same type of property as the Project being financed as long as the operation at the other location has the same NAICS code as the operation at the Project location. b) Costs essential to the refinancing, such as prepayment penalties, financing fees or other refinancing costs, required by the original terms of the debt instrument, may be included in the debt refinance portion of a Project. c) The total debt being refinanced may consist of one or more loans.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_300_722407895", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The financing will provide a substantial benefit to the Borrower when prepayment penalties, financing fees, and other financing costs are accounted for. “Substantial Benefit” means that the portion of the new installment amounts attributable to the debt being refinanced must be at least 10% less than the existing installment amount(s). The total installment amount is determined by adding the two installment amounts attributable to the refinancing using the interest rate of the most recent debenture funding on the 504 loan and the committed interest rate of the Third Party Lender loan. The total amount must be 10% less than the existing installment amount(s). a) Prepayment penalties, financing fees, and other financing costs must also be added to the amount being refinanced in calculating the percentage reduction in the new installment payment. b) Loans with seasonal payments would meet the Substantial Benefit test if there was a 10% improvement in the installment when calculated by averaging all payments over the most recent twelve month period from date of application and comparing that to the new installment amount attributable to the debt being refinanced. c) Loans with balloon payments meet the Substantial Benefit test independent of the 10% reduction requirement. d) Exceptions to the 10% reduction requirement may be approved by the D/FA or designee for good cause. PCLP CDCs may not use their delegated authority to approve a loan requiring this exception. vii. The Borrower has been current on all payments due on the existing debt for not less than 1 year preceding the date of refinancing. “Date of refinancing” refers to the date the 504 loan is approved by SBA. The CDC must submit a transcript of account, or similar documentation containing detailed payment history from the lender whose debt is being refinanced reflecting that the loan has been current (not to exceed 30 days in arrears) for 1 year (or for the time the debt has been open if less than 1 year). Any unremedied delinquency after approval must be reported to SBA as an adverse change. viii. The financing under section 504 will provide better terms or rate of interest than the existing indebtedness on the date of refinancing. “Better terms or rate of interest” may include longer maturity (but always commensurate with the assets’ useful life), a lower interest rate committed on the Third Party Lender Loan or projected on the 504 Loan, improved collateral conditions, or less restrictive loan covenants. PCLP authority must not be used to refinance Same Institution Debt. “Same Institution Debt” is defined as any debt of the CDC or the Third Party Lender financing the new project, or of affiliates of either. 13 CFR § 120.882(e)(8) Whether the new project is within the CDC’s area of operation is based on the assets newly acquired for the business and not on the assets securing the debt being refinanced.

Evidence must be approved by SBA with the exception of PCLP CDCs, which must document the file with evidence regarding the CDC’s capability to close and service the loan and monitor the collateral. Instruments resulting in transfer of ownership of the property to the Applicant may be eligible for refinancing, including, but not limited to, land sales contracts, contracts for deed or capital leases. The purchase of property under an operating lease is eligible for 504 financing, but the operating lease itself is not eligible for debt refinancing. In order to be eligible for debt refinancing, a copy of the corresponding debt and lien instruments must be submitted with the application.

For more information on fees, see Section A, Ch. 4, Para. E, 504 Loan Program Fees and Use of Agents. Examples of Borrower’ s out-of-pocket costs include: Settlement agent’s fees; Overnight delivery, postage, and messenger services; Certifications required by SBA (such as earthquake, flood, IRS, Certificate of Occupancy, and certificate of completion); and Copying costs attributable to the above. 13. Change of Ownership Projects that result in a change of ownership are eligible under the following circumstances: i. The 504 Project finances only the costs associated with eligible long-term fixed assets; the acquisition of any other assets such as receivables or goodwill is not an eligible use of 504 loan proceeds or Third Party Loan proceeds and must be financed by other means, which may include a 7(a) loan; ii. The application documents that jobs will be created or retained because of the change of ownership. The application must demonstrate that there is a reasonable basis upon which to conclude that the retained jobs would be lost without the change of ownership. This can be in the form of a statement from the seller to that effect with supporting facts or other certification acceptable to the SLPC. iii. Loan proceeds may be used to finance a change of ownership between existing owners in an existing EPC when the asset(s) of the EPC are limited to real estate and/or other eligible long-term fixed assets that the EPC leases to one or more Operating Companies (“OC”) for conducting the OC’s business and when the change of ownership will result in the purchasing owner(s) owning 100% of the EPC.

See Section A, Ch. 2, Para. B.1, Eligible Passive Companies for more information on EPC/OC requirements. The 504 loan proceeds must not be used to purchase stock or any other ownership interest in a business unless, by purchasing the stock or other ownership interest, the Applicant is purchasing the real estate where the Applicant is located and/or other eligible long-term fixed assets used in the Applicant’s business operation. To the extent the value of the stock or other ownership interest exceeds the value of the real estate and/or other eligible long-term fixed assets (“excess value”): i. The excess value cannot be financed by the Project financing; it must be financed separately; and ii. The excess value must be de minimis compared to the value of the real estate and/or other eligible long-term fixed asset(s).

Businesses owned by ESOPs CDCs may make loans to an eligible business owned or controlled by an ESOP or equivalent trust. The ESOP must be in compliance with IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor requirements. Prior to first disbursement, the CDC must obtain documentation that the ESOP or equivalent trust meets the requirements of all applicable IRS, Treasury, and Department of Labor regulations. The IRS prohibits ESOPs from guarantying a loan; therefore, SBA does not require the ESOP to guarantee the loan.

Debenture Limits (Minimum and Maximum) 13 CFR § § 120.930 and 120.931 Net Debenture Proceeds is defined in 13 CFR 120.802 as the portion of Debenture proceeds that finance eligible Project costs (excluding administrative costs). The Gross Debenture is the Net Debenture Proceeds plus the eligible administrative costs. The Gross Debenture is subject to the following dollar limits and conditions: The minimum dollar amount for a debenture is $25,000. 13 CFR § 120.930(b) For all 504 Projects except for Eligible Energy Public Policy Projects and Projects for Small Manufacturers, the gross debenture is limited to an outstanding balance of $5,000,000 maximum in the aggregate for each small business concern, including its affiliates. SBA considers an EPC and an OC to be “one business” for this purpose. This limit applies to all 504 Projects except for the Projects identified in c. and d. below.

The outstanding Gross Debentures issued for a small business concern, including affiliates, for Eligible Energy Public Policy Projects must not exceed $16,500,000 in the aggregate. ii. The $5,500,000 limit for each Project is not reduced by any other outstanding SBA loan guaranties that the Borrower and its affiliates have received through other SBA loan programs. iii. Loans made for Eligible Energy Public Policy Projects do not reduce the $5,000,000 limit for each small business concern for other 504 Projects.

Loan Maturities 13 CFR § 120.933 Maturity of the 504 loan is 10, 20, or 25 years based upon the remaining useful life of the property being financed as follows: i. A maximum of 25 years for real estate; ii. A minimum of 10 years for machinery and equipment; and When the Project includes both real estate and machinery and equipment, the maturity will be based on the asset category that constitutes the majority of loan proceeds. A Third Party Loan must have a term of at least 7 years when the 504 loan is for a term of 10 years and 10 years when the 504 loan is for 20 or 25 years. If there is more than one Third Party Loan, an overall loan maturity must be calculated, taking into account the maturities and amounts of each loan. If there is a balloon payment, it must be justified in the loan report and clearly identified in the SBA issued E-Tran terms and conditions. ( 13 CFR § 120.921(a)) 3. Interest Rates The interest rate for 10, 20, and 25 year 504 debentures is based on market conditions for long-term government debt at the time of sale. Most commonly, the 10-year Treasury Rate is used as a benchmark for the 20-year and 25-year debenture rates, and the 5-year Treasury Rate is used as a benchmark for the 10-year debenture rate.

Certified Development Companies (CDCs) must analyze each application in a commercially reasonable manner, consistent with prudent lending standards. The analysis must be acceptable to SLPC. On 504 loans, the cash flow of the Applicant is the primary source of repayment, not any expected recovery from the liquidation of collateral. Thus, if the CDC’s financial analysis demonstrates that the Applicant lacks reasonable assurance of repayment in a timely manner from the cash flow of the business, the loan request must be declined, regardless of the collateral available. The credit strengths and weaknesses of the proposed project must be identified and discussed by the CDC along with any mitigating factors. 1. CDC Credit Memorandum The CDC’s credit memorandum must address the following: a. Pro-Forma Balance Sheet Analysis i. A pro-forma balance sheet is created from a current business balance sheet that has been adjusted for all changes in assets and liabilities as a result of the Project, including the Third Party Loan, 504 loan, other new debt, any required equity injection, the use of loan proceeds, and the costs of getting the loan(s) (such as fees and closing costs). ii. The pro-forma balance sheet analysis must include a complete debt schedule and discussion on the types and terms of the existing loans, debt, or credit facilities. iii. The CDC must identify and discuss issues resulting from any anomalies or variances on the balance sheet. b. Repayment Ability Analysis The analysis must address the following: i. If the Applicant is meeting SBA Size Standards under the: a) Alternative Size Standards – Include balance sheets, income statements, and Federal income tax returns for the previous 2 years, or the number of years the Applicant has generated revenue, whichever is less, b) Industry Size Standard–- Include balance sheets, income statements, and Federal income tax returns for the previous 3 years, or the number of years the Applicant has generated revenue, whichever is less. ii. The repayment ability analysis must address debt service coverage. Debt Service is defined as the future required principal and interest payments on all business debt inclusive of new SBA loan proceeds. The Applicant’s debt service coverage ratio (operating cash flow divided by debt service) must be equal to or greater than 1:1 based on calculations acceptable to SLPC. iii. If the historical cash flow does not show sufficient debt service coverage after the effects of the SBA loan, the CDC must analyze projections in accordance with subparagraph v., “Projection-based projects,” below.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_307_770916905", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Projection-based projects: a) For projection-based projects, the analysis must include a minimum of 2 years of projections. b) The CDC must calculate the projected debt service coverage and provide the assumptions supporting the projected cash flow coverage. c) The analysis must support and justify the reasonableness and attainability of the assumptions, including as applicable: i) Justification for anticipated sales volume and/or revenue growth as a result of new product lines, sales channels, and new production facilities; ii) Justification for any reduction in expenses; and iii) Comparison to current industry trends. d) If the projections show repayment in Year 2 but not in Year 1, sufficient liquidity must be shown to cover the shortfall in Year 1. e) If applicable, the CDC must describe how the Applicant will make interest payments and pay for operations during construction. c. Borrower’s Contribution i. The Borrower must contribute cash (or property acceptable to SBA obtained with the cash) or land (that is part of the Project Property) to the Project, or funds that were borrowed (subordinate to the Third Party loan and the 504 debenture, and, without SBA’s written approval, may not be repaid at a faster rate than the 504 loan), in an amount equal to the following, excluding administrative costs: a) All Borrowers must contribute at least 10%, which may be borrowed as long as it is subordinate to the Third Party Loan and the 504 debenture; b) New businesses must contribute at least 15%. The Debenture will finance no more than 35% of the Project and at least 50% of the Project financing will be from banks or other financial institutions, state or local government, or foundations or other non-profit institutions. c) Businesses with a Limited or Special Purpose Property: i. Must contribute at least 15%, in which case the Debenture will finance no more than 35% of the Project and at least 50% of the Project financing will be from banks or other financial institutions, state or local government, or foundations or other non-profit institutions. ii.

SBA allows Borrower’s equity in equipment to be counted toward Borrower Contribution in 504 debt refinancing with and without expansion if the debt was originally used to acquire the specific equipment. The Borrower’s equity in land and/or buildings and/or equipment previously acquired may be counted toward the Borrower’s contribution if the land and/or buildings and/or equipment are part of the Project. v.

The Debenture will finance no more than 30% of the Project and at least 50% of the Project financing will be from state or local government, banks or other financial institutions, foundations or other non-profit institutions. ii. The additional Borrower’s contribution will reduce the SBA’s portion of the financing. iii. The Borrower’s equity in land and/or buildings previously acquired may be counted toward the Borrower’s contribution if the land and/or buildings are part of the Project. iv. If the Borrower’s contribution is borrowed: a) Any lien position on the Project Property must be subordinate to the 504 loan; b) Only in situations where the borrowed contribution is collateralized by the Project Property, Borrower may not pay the loan for its contribution at a faster rate than the 504 loan (13 CFR § 120.912 ) unless it is approved in writing by the D/FA or designee; and c) If the borrowed contribution is collateralized by assets other than the Project Property, the Borrower must demonstrate repayment of the loan for its contribution from the cash flow of the business or other sources. d. Additional Borrower’s Contribution and/or Collateral The required Borrower’s contribution, as set forth in paragraph 1.c. immediately above, and collateral, as set forth in paragraph 2.a. of this Chapter below, on SBA 504 loans are the minimums required by policy. However, in some cases it may be appropriate to consider additional Borrower contribution and/or collateral to mitigate the credit weaknesses of a proposed project.

Collateral i. SBA’s 504 Collateral Policy 13 CFR §120.934 When assessing the adequacy of collateral, the CDC must consider the impact that covenants and other restrictions recorded against the collateral may have on its value and marketability. The CDC must document this analysis in the file. Examples of items to review include: a) Deed restrictions, covenants, easement provisions, reversionary interests, subordinations, leases and options and other provisions that restrict the use of the property for the benefit of a third party (note:", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_314_467716164", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

SBA usually takes a second lien position on Project Property but may have a shared lien (pari passu) with the Third Party Lender. ii. Adequacy of Collateral: a) SBA’s second lien position will generally be considered adequate. SBA may consider other factors in determining the adequacy of SBA’s collateral including but not limited to the following: i) Strong, consistent cash flow that is sufficient to cover the debt; ii) Demonstrated, proven management; iii) The Applicant has been in operation for more than 2 years; and iv) The proposed Project is a logical extension of the applicant’s current operations. b) Because leasehold improvements provide minimal collateral value, the CDC must consider requiring additional collateral. c) Do not encumber assets or require additional contributions that the Borrower needs to sustain ongoing operations. Taking additional collateral with minimal liquidation value only serves to limit the Borrower’s ability to obtain additional short-term financing while offering little or no additional protection to SBA. d) If the loan is not fully collateralized by business assets, available personal assets must be pledged to secure the guaranty. See Section A, Ch. 5, Para. A, Guaranties , for more information. e) Lien position on real estate is generally evidenced by a title insurance policy. If the title insurance policy contains a clause requiring arbitration or a clause allowing either party to demand arbitration in the case of a dispute, an endorsement to the policy must be obtained deleting that condition. If the policy requires that both parties agree to arbitration, no endorsement is necessary. iii. Third Party Loan: a) The Third Party Lender usually has a 1 st lien on the Project Property, and SBA cannot guarantee these loans.

Mixed Use Collateral: When one 504 debenture finances both real estate and significant shorter term assets, such as machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures, the CDC should consider the following: a) Taking, along with the Third Party Lender, lien positions based upon proportional shares in the financing of the Project; b) Taking a 1st lien position on the shorter term assets. SBA requires at least a 2nd lien position unless there is a lien from an existing 504 loan on the assets; c) Requiring additional equity or collateral; or d) Removing the shorter term assets from the Project and have them financed by another source. b.

(b) If an appraisal is not required under the preceding paragraphs, the CDC must obtain an appropriate evaluation of the Project Property being acquired with the loan proceeds that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Evaluations are not required to be performed in accordance with USPAP or by a State licensed or certified appraiser but should be consistent with the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines and the Interagency Advisory on the Use of Evaluations in Real Estate-Related Financial Transactions, issued by the Federal Banking Regulators. b) The appraiser must be: i) Independent and have no appearance of a conflict of interest (such as a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the property or transaction, independent of the loan production function, and not involved in the approval of the transaction); and ii) Either State-licensed or State-certified with the following exception: when the Project Property’s estimated value is over $1,000,000, the appraiser must be State-certified. c) The “Appraisal Report” must be prepared in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and dated no more than twelve months prior to the date of application. d) In order for the appraiser to identify the scope of work appropriately, the appraisal must identify SBA as the client or an intended user of the appraisal, as those terms are defined in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). The CDC may also be identified as the client or an intended user. It is acceptable to SBA if the appraisal identifies the Third Party Lender as the client and SBA as intended user. The CDC may not use an appraisal prepared for the applicant. The cost may be passed on to the Borrower. e) If the loan will be used to finance new construction or the substantial renovation of an existing building, the appraisal must estimate what the market value will be at completion of construction. (“Substantial” means rehabilitation expenses of more than one-third of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of the application.)

If the CDC cannot obtain such a statement, then the CDC cannot close the loan without the Sacramento Loan Processing Center’s (SLPC) prior written permission. f) If the loan will be used to acquire an existing building that does not require construction, the appraiser should estimate market value on an as-is basis. If the appraiser estimates the value other than on an as-is basis, the narrative must include an explanation of why the as-is basis was not used. g) If the appraisal engagement letter asks the appraiser for a business enterprise or going concern value, the appraiser must allocate separate values to the individual components of the transaction including land, building, equipment, and business (including intangible assets). h) When the collateral is a Special Purpose Property, the appraiser must be experienced in the particular industry. i) An appraisal must be submitted and approved by the SLPC (except on Delegated loans) prior to closing. If the appraisal comes in at less than 90% of the estimated value, the debenture must be reduced or, if available, the CDC must secure additional collateral or additional investment from the Borrower and/or guarantors that will be added to the required Borrower’s Contribution and will be sufficient to address the gap in value. If additional collateral or additional investment is not available, but the applicant demonstrates strong, consistent cash flow sufficient to support the debt, then the SLPC can approve the appraisal and the CDC may close the loan. j) An appraisal must be submitted to the SLPC with the application under the following circumstances: i) Equity in land owned for 2 years or more is being contributed as part of Borrower’s contribution; ii) The real estate is Third Party Lender’s OREO; or iii) The Project will finance a transaction involving parties with a close relationship (for example, transactions between existing owners or family members). iv) The seller of the property is carrying back a loan that is part of the Borrower’s contribution. ii. Equipment Appraisal: SBA requires that an equipment appraisal be obtained when used equipment is part of the Project and is either being purchased from someone other than an equipment dealer or being refinanced. The equipment appraisal needs to be a written document from a person that is qualified to provide a valuation, is independent of the transaction, and has performed an on-site inspection of", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_318_538391517", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Non-commercial real estate or real estate securing a personal guaranty: SBA has no specific appraisal requirements for non-commercial real estate (such as a residence) or real estate (commercial or non-commercial) taken as collateral to secure a personal guaranty. F. SUBMISSION OF LOAN APPLICATION 1. Processing Methods All 504 loans are processed in the SLPC. Non-delegated (without the use of the Abridged Submission Method): When a CDC submits an SBA 504 application under the non-delegated processing method, the CDC submits the application and supporting documents to SBA through E-Tran. SBA will make the final determination as to the eligibility of the Applicant, use of proceeds, the credit decision, including adequacy of collateral pledged, structure of the loan, and the Borrower’s contribution of the Applicant. Abridged Submission Method (ASM): ASM is a streamlined loan application processing procedure, which does not involve the exercise of any delegated authority. Accredited Lenders Program (ALP): SBA delegates to ALP CDCs increased authority to process, close and service 504 loans. (13 CFR § 120.840) CDCs processing loans under their ALP authority will use one of the processing methods as described in this paragraph 1.a. or b. PCLP CDC: Under the Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP), SBA delegates to PCLP CDCs increased authority to process, close, service and liquidate 504 loans, and may also give PCLP CDCs increased authority to litigate 504 loans (13 CFR § 120.845). Loans processed under PCLP CDC authority are subject to the same loan terms and conditions as other 504 loans, but SBA delegates to the PCLP CDC all loan approval decisions except certain eligibility issues. The SOP indicates where PCLP CDCs are required to process 504 loans using non-delegated processing. 2. Contents of a 504 Loan Application The CDC must maintain the following documents and any that support the CDC’s credit decision in the CDC’s loan files. CDC files must be available for review by SBA at any time. The CDC completes or obtains the following: i. SBA Form 1244, “Application for Section 504 Loan.” Must list all Beneficial Owners of at least 20% of the Applicant, and at least 51% of the total Beneficial Owners of the Applicant (additional sheets may be attached to the Form 1244 if necessary).

SBA E-TRAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS The E-Tran terms and conditions is SBA’s agreement between the SBA and the CDC providing the terms and conditions under which SBA will issue a debenture. 1. Loan Conditions (13 CFR § 120.160): SBA establishes the wording for the standard 504 E-Tran terms and conditions. The SBA-authorized E-Tran terms and conditions for 504 loans must use the pre- approved conditions that are found in the Boilerplate. The party responsible for drafting the SBA E-Tran terms and conditions is determined by the program the loan is processed under: i. Regular and ALP: The CDC drafts the SBA E-Tran terms and conditions and the SBA finalizes and executes and sends to the CDC for execution ii. PCLP: CDC drafts and executes on SBA’s behalf SBA counsel must review and approve any E-Tran terms and conditions with the following exception. When processing a loan under PCLP lending authority, PCLP CDCs may develop E-Tran terms and conditions and use them without prior SBA approval, provided they are only used one time. Whenever a PCLP CDC develops and uses a non-standard condition, an explanation for its development must be in the loan file. 2. Disbursement Period, Interest Rates and Loan Maturity: Disbursement Period: The loan must be disbursed within 48 months from the date of approval. SBA will automatically cancel undisbursed dollars. For Debt Refinance without Expansion, the loan must be disbursed within 9 months from the date of approval. The Denver Finance Center (DFC) will make a reasonable effort to mail an initial message to the CDC approximately 3 months prior to taking action on undisbursed funds. The message will inform the CDC of the undisbursed dollar amount and will provide a date on which the dollars will be automatically cancelled. After the 3-month message has expired, DFC will make a reasonable effort to mail a second message on the day the automatic cancellation is processed. Interest Rate: The interest rate for 10, 20, and 25 year 504 debentures is based on market conditions for long-term government debt at the time of sale. 13 CFR § 120.932 Maturity is 10, 20, or 25 years based upon the remaining useful life of the property being financed, in accordance with Chapter 1, Para. D.2, Loan Maturities. 3.

B, IRS Tax Transcript/Verification of Financial Information. 6. Standby Agreements: SBA Form 155,“Standby Agreement.” CDC may use SBA Form 155 or its own equivalent standby agreement form. A copy of the note must be attached to the standby agreement. Standby Creditor must subordinate any lien rights in collateral securing the Loan to CDC’s rights in the collateral and take no action against Applicant or any collateral securing the Standby Debt without CDC’s consent. 7. Assignment of Lease and Landlord’s Waiver: If applicable, the E-Tran terms and conditions must include conditions for assignment of lease and landlord’s waiver. 8. Construction Loan Provisions: In the construction of a new building or an addition to an existing building, the CDC must obtain: i. Evidence of compliance with the “\"National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Building”\" (NEHRP), or a building code that has substantially equivalent provisions. (13 CFR § 120.174 ) a) The NEHRP provisions may be found in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard 7 and the International Building Code.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_324_753320654", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The E-Tran terms and conditions must address the NEHRP provision when any of the use of proceeds options selected includes construction financing, including leasehold improvements. If the leasehold improvements made with loan proceeds will become permanently affixed to any structure on the leased premises, then they must comply with the NEHRP. If the leasehold improvements are only temporary, they do not need to comply with the NEHRP. Accordingly, if the Applicant can demonstrate that the leasehold improvements will be temporary, CDC may request modification of the SBA E-Tran terms and conditions to remove the NEHRP provision in accordance with paragraph B., Modifying the SBA E-Tran Terms and Conditions , of this Chapter. The CDC must certify that the Project was completed in accordance with the final plans and specifications unless a minor portion of the project has been escrowed for a valid reason. (13 CFR § 120.891) If the interim financing comes from a CDC, the following additional conditions must be required in the E-Tran terms and conditions: i. Mortgages must be recorded prior to beginning construction. ii. Inspections must be made by a qualified engineer, appraiser, or other party satisfactory to SBA prior to all progress disbursements. iii. The Applicant must furnish a firm construction contract to the CDC from an acceptable contractor at a specified price, including a provision that no material changes are to be made without the prior written consent of the CDC; iv. The contractor must furnish builder’s risk and workers’ compensation insurance; v. One complete set of plans and specifications of the proposed construction must be submitted to the CDC; vi. Where the CDC or the Applicant is to inject funds into the construction project, these funds must be used prior to the disbursement of the interim financing; vii. The CDC must make and document periodic inspections of construction; and viii. When loan funds will be used to improve buildings on leased land, assignment of the lease must be obtained. 9.

MODIFYING THE SBA E-TRAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. The CDC must request in writing SBA’s approval of modifications to the terms and conditions of the 504 loan at any time after approval but before funding: For an increase or decrease in the amount of an approved loan, the 327 action must clearly support the need for the change in the amount and address the effects on repayment ability, collateral and jobs created or retained. The 327 action must also provide the revised breakdown of the private sector lender, debenture, and Applicant’s injection, including a revised use of funds. Any adjustments to or changes in ownership of the Borrower, including percentage of ownership. CDCs may not unilaterally approve such adjustments or changes. 2. CDCs may use their unilateral authority to submit the following 327 actions using the 504 E-Tran system: 504 Loan Cancellation (prior to closing); Borrower, EPC or OC mailing address. Note: CDCs must not exercise unilateral authority to change the address of the Project Property; Borrower, EPC or OC phone numbers and email addresses; and Principal or guarantor mailing address, phone number, and email address. 3. For loans approved under PCLP authority: Generally, PCLP CDCs may modify and extend the E-Tran terms and conditions using their unilateral authority. PCLP CDCs must upload the final modified executed terms and conditions to E-Tran within 15 business days after debenture funding.

Verification that the proposed changes to the ownership of the Borrower comply with limitations on the aggregate amount of SBA portions of all loans to a Borrower, including affiliates; and ii. Verification that there has been no prior loss to the Government caused by the new owner(s) or any business owned, operated, or controlled by the new owner(s). PCLP CDCs must obtain approval for increases or decreases in the loan amount directly in E-Tran. Approval of the requested increase or decrease in E-Tran will constitute SBA’s prior written consent. 4. Post-approval modifications (327 actions) must be submitted to the SLPC through the 504 E-Tran system. Detailed guidance on the 504 E-Tran submission process is available on the SBA website in the 504 E-Tran User Guide for Submitting Loan Applications. 5. Neither the amount nor the maturity of a loan can be modified after the debenture closing has been completed. C. CLOSING, DISBURSEMENT, AND POST-CLOSING 1. Interim Financing A construction escrow account may be used with SBA’s prior approval if acquisition of machinery and equipment or other portions of a project (such as a parking lot, landscaping, etc.) represents a relatively minor portion of the total project, and it has been contracted for delivery at a specified price and date, but cannot be installed or delivered prior to acquisition or completion of the plant, the debenture may be sold, provided (see Paragraph A.8, Construction Loan Provisions, of this Chapter): i. The proceeds authorized for acquisition of such assets are held in escrow by the CSA, Title Company, CDC attorney, or bank to complete Project components; ii. All required lien positions and collateral are obtained prior to closing; iii. Disbursement from such account(s) must be approved by the CDC and SBA, supported by invoices, and be made payable jointly to the small business and the designated contractor; and iv. Funds not disbursed after 1 year will be applied to pay down the Third Party Lender’s loan. The interim financing must be fully disbursed and the project completed prior to the sale of the Debenture with one exception. A portion of the debenture proceeds may be put into an escrow account to complete a minor portion of the total project (see 13 CFR § 120.961 ). The Interim Lender must make a number of certifications at the time of the debenture closing.

If the Interim Lender cannot certify as required, then the debenture cannot be funded. 2. Escrow Closing Escrow Closing (No Interim Financing) 1 When a Project is to acquire an existing facility that the Borrower will immediately occupy, SBA may allow an Escrow Closing instead of requiring Interim Financing. The requirements for an Escrow Closing are as follows: Escrow Account: i. SBA counsel must approve the Escrow Agreement, which will be signed by the CDC, SBA, the Borrower, and the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent must be approved by the CDC and SBA counsel, and the Escrow Agent must follow the escrow instructions provided by the CDC and SBA counsel. The CDC counsel, Title Company or other party approved by SBA counsel may act as the Escrow Agent and hold the Escrow Account. ii. The Borrower must deposit an additional 10% of the Total Project Costs into the Escrow Account. This deposit must be in cash or an irrevocable Letter of Credit. The CDC must provide SBA counsel with evidence of the Borrower’s deposit at the time of closing of the 504 Loan. iii. The net Debenture sale proceeds must be wired directly into the Escrow Account. iv. The funds in the Escrow Account may not be distributed and the Escrow Account may not be dissolved until the CDC and CDC counsel provide a certification to SBA that: a) A post-Debenture funding updated title commitment has been issued and reviewed showing the title and lien positions required by the E-Tran terms and conditions for Debenture Guarantee (SBA 504 Loan); b) As a result of the review, the CDC and CDC counsel have determined that upon release of the funds in the Escrow Account at the scheduled Project Property real estate closing and subsequent recordation, title to the Project Property will transfer to the Borrower, all collateral documents will be properly filed, and all lien positions will be properly perfected; c) CDC counsel will ensure that all title and lien positions required by the E-Tran terms and conditions are properly recorded and that a final title policy is issued; and 1 This subparagraph “Escrow Closing (No Interim Financing)” will not be available for use until SBA has announced that the necessary forms have been created and/or revised, as appropriate.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_328_614091664", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

After receipt of the foregoing certification, SBA counsel will determine if all of the requirements for dissolution of the Escrow Account have been met, and if so, will provide the Escrow Agent and the CDC with written approval for the distribution of the funds in the Escrow Account. v. All of the requirements for dissolution of the Escrow Account must be met to SBA counsel’s satisfaction no later than 5 months from the date of the Debenture sale. If not, SBA counsel will direct the Escrow Agent and the CDC to use the funds in the Escrow Account to pre-pay the Debenture in full. Any leftover funds in the Escrow Account after the Debenture is pre- paid in full will be returned to the Borrower. vi. CDC counsel must provide SBA with a post-Project Property real estate closing legal opinion stating that: a) All title and lien positions required by the E-Tran terms and conditions have been properly recorded; and b) A final title policy reflecting the same has been delivered to SBA. Borrower must agree in the Escrow Agreement that: i. The required Borrower’s deposit will be used to make up the difference between the amount of the net Debenture sale proceeds and the amount required to pre-pay the Debenture in full. This difference includes the following: a) Debenture sale costs paid from the Gross Debenture sale proceeds such as the CDC processing fee, CSA fee, CDC attorney’s fees/closing costs, SBA Guarantee Fee, Funding Fee and Underwriter’s Fee; and b) The costs of pre-paying the Debenture including the prepayment premium and 6 months’ worth of interest on the original Debenture amount. ii. If all of the requirements for dissolution of the Escrow Account are not met to SBA counsel’s satisfaction within 5 months of the date of the Debenture sale, the Debenture shall be pre-paid using the funds in the Escrow Account. iii. The Borrower must make all regularly scheduled 504 Loan payments after the Debenture sale. 3. Responsibility for Closing the 504 Loan and Debenture The CDC is responsible for the 504 loan closing, including compliance with all SBA Loan Program Requirements. Each CDC has its own division of labor and dictates the CDC Counsel’s role. Although SBA counsel is available for advice and assistance, the CDC and its attorney are ultimately responsible for the 504 Loan closing.

CDC must prepare the documents necessary for closing the debenture. SBA counsel reviews the loan closing package for legal sufficiency and opines whether SBA may guarantee the debenture. (13 CFR § 120.960) All CDC Counsel (including Designated Attorneys and those without Designated status) who submit 504 Loan closing packages to SBA must use the form Opinion of CDC Counsel. The Opinion of CDC Counsel requires the CDC Counsel to acknowledge that SBA will rely upon the Opinion in guaranteeing the Debenture. Additionally, the Opinion requires the CDC Counsel to certify that the CDC Counsel is a licensed, active member, in good standing, of the Bar of the applicable state. If closing deficiencies that cause a loss on the 504 loan occur, SBA may pursue a claim against the CDC Counsel for the closing deficiencies. SBA will also expect the CDC to timely pursue any claims the CDC may have against the CDC Counsel as a result of closing deficiencies. Additionally, all CDC Counsel are considered to be Agents who conduct business with SBA under 13 CFR 103.1(a). The regulation at 13 CFR 103.4 provides that SBA may suspend or revoke an Agent’s privilege to conduct business with SBA for good cause, including violations of ethical guidelines which govern the profession or business of the Agent or which are published at any time by SBA. Finally, as set forth in paragraph C.5.h., Withdrawal of Designated Attorney Status below, good cause for withdrawal of Designated Attorney status includes, among other things, submission of unsatisfactory 504 closing packages. Priority CDCs may not use in-house counsel as its designated attorney. Because the opinion of counsel is only one component of the loan closing, a CDC may not use its in-house counsel to close a 504 loan and obtain an opinion of counsel from an outside designated attorney. The very limited circumstances under which one attorney performs the closing and another attorney provides the opinion of counsel are outlined in the boilerplate opinion of counsel and involve a project in one state and the CDC counsel in another. 4. The Closing Package Types of Loan Closing Packages: i. Regular closing package submitted by either non-Priority CDCs or Priority CDCs who are not using a Designated Attorney; and ii. Expedited closing package submitted by a Priority CDC using a Designated Attorney under the expedited closing process. The Closing Package: i. CDCs and SBA must use SBA Form 2286, “504 Debenture Closing Checklist,” (Checklist) for all 504 debenture closings. The Checklist lists the documents SBA requires to determine whether the debenture can be sold to fund the loan. It is not intended to include all the items the CDC will need to properly close the loan. ii. SBA requires that the CDC submit to SBA counsel for review a completed SBA Form 2286 along with the required items on the Checklist.

Mandatory Forms: a) Documents on the Checklist that have an SBA form number b) Opinion of CDC Counsel; and c) The SBA-approved environmental indemnification agreement. CDCs may use their own forms for the lien instruments on Project Property and secondary collateral. Those forms must be either state bar-approved forms or approved by SBA counsel prior to submission. The lien instruments on real estate must contain a due-on-sale clause. 5. Designated Attorney 13 CFR § 120.802 A Designated Attorney is the CDC closing attorney that SBA has approved to close loans under an expedited closing process for a Priority CDC. To become a Designated Attorney, an attorney must submit evidence of: i. A degree from a recognized law school; ii. Membership in the bar of the state in which the attorney’s 504 closing practice is or will be primarily located; iii. Professional malpractice insurance coverage: a) With limits of at least $1,000,000/$1,000,000; and b) A deductible not to exceed $20,000 for individuals and firms with 3 or fewer attorneys, $50,000 for law firms with more than 3 attorneys or $100,000 for large law firms with more than 25 attorneys. c) Applicants may request from the General Counsel, or designee, an increase in the deductible or a hardship exemption with respect to the policy limits. Policy limit reductions to $500,000/$1,000,000 will only be granted to sole practitioners and small firms of three or fewer attorneys, while deductible requirement waivers will only be granted to larger firms with a demonstrated, strong financial history. The General Counsel, or designee, will consider a number of factors when deciding whether to grant or renew a hardship waiver, including, but not limited to, the documentation provided in support of the waiver request, the number of 504 loan closings by the Designated Attorney in the prior 12 months, the total dollar amount of the 504 loans closed by the Designated Attorney in the prior 12 months, and the overall quality of the loan closing packages received from the Designated Attorney. If approved, a hardship waiver will have a duration of 1 year. If an attorney obtains designated status, renewals of hardship waivers may be sought annually for as long as the hardship exists.

All other relevant financial information should also be provided. iv. Attendance at an SBA-approved 504 loan closing training course. Attorneys may fulfill this requirement up to 1 year prior to designation or within 6 months after designation; and v. Adequate expertise in 504 loan closings. Process to request Designated Attorney status: i. The CDC nominates the attorney by submitting an application to Lead District Office in which the attorney’s practice is primarily located. An application must include: a) A submission on the attorney’s letterhead addressing each of the conditions in the previous paragraph; b) A copy of the attorney’s malpractice insurance policy, or a certificate of insurance or declarations page showing the: i) Amount of coverage and deductible; ii) Premium; and iii) Name of the attorney insured. c) If the attorney requests a hardship exemption with respect to the insurance policy limits or a waiver of the amount of the deductible, the attorney must include the request with the application, supported by appropriate information, including: i) The amount of their policy limits or deductible; and ii) The current premium; iii) The quote obtained for the increased premium to meet SBA’s minimum professional malpractice insurance requirements (absent a hardship waiver); iv) The size of the firm; v) The firm’s arrangement for covering the deductible, such as a loss reserve or escrow; vi) Evidence of the firm’s history and financial strength; and vii) For sole practitioners or law firms with fewer than three attorneys, personal financial statements for each attorney seeking Designated Attorney status.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_332_57127363", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

A designated attorney cannot be: a) An employee of the CDC or of an Associate of the CDC; or b) On the board of the CDC, participate in its lending decisions, or otherwise be too closely associated with the CDC, as determined by SBA counsel. ii. An attorney may be a member of the CDC, but not an officer, provided SBA counsel determines the attorney is not too closely associated with the CDC. SBA counsel must consider the attorney’s relationship with the CDC including: a) The degree of control exerted by the attorney on the CDC’s decision- making; b) Any benefits accruing to the attorney through the attorney’s association with the CDC; and c) Any appearance of conflict of interest. The Lead District Office forwards the application to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) with the recommendations of the District Director, District Counsel and other SBA District Offices, if applicable. OGC will notify the attorney in writing that he/she has been accepted as a designated 504 closing attorney. The Lead District Office must allow a CDC to use a non-designated attorney for a reasonable time to develop an additional designated attorney or to replace a designated attorney. In either event, SBA counsel will accept the closing package from a non-designated attorney and conduct a non-priority closing review. To maintain Designated Attorney status, an attorney must: i.

Submit evidence of attendance at an SBA-approved closing update course every 2 years. The attorney may take the course any time within the calendar year that their status would expire to maintain their status. Withdrawal of Designated Attorney status: The General Counsel, or designee, may withdraw an attorney’s Designated status for good cause, including, but not limited to: unprofessional or unethical conduct; failure to maintain the required insurance coverage; failure to attend the required training; submission of unsatisfactory 504 closing packages (based upon reviews or other evidence); failure to maintain a good working relationship and good communication with SBA; failure to maintain membership and good standing in the bar(s) of all states in which the attorney is approved to serve as designated counsel; and/or failure to comply materially with an SBA Loan Program Requirement. 6. Closing and Post-Closing Activities a. CDC’s Responsibilities The CDC must: i. Certify that the Project costs were paid in full and that the Project proceeds were used in accordance with the requirements of the E-Tran terms and conditions, and that each party to the Project contributed the required amount to the costs. To support this certification, the CDC must have evidence of the use of proceeds and the contributions by each party (Third Party Lender, Interim Lender, and Borrower). Sufficient evidence is: a) For the purchase of land and/or building, a signed or certified Settlement Statement, or its equivalent, showing the amounts paid and whether paid by the Borrower or from the Third Party Lender or Interim Lender’s loan proceeds. b) For construction or renovations, i) Copy of construction contract and all change orders; ii) Evidence of each progress payment and final payment of project reflecting cumulative costs and source of payment (Third Party Lender, Interim Lender, or Borrower);", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_334_536136101", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Notify SBA counsel in writing of planned debenture closings at least 30 days before the SBA District Office deadline for CDCs to submit closing packages. This notification is for SBA counsel’s planning purposes only and the CDC may ultimately submit more, fewer or different closing packages. iii. Request from the SLPC all necessary modifications to the E-Tran terms and conditions before submitting closing packages as far in advance of submitting the loan closing package as possible. The CDC must obtain SBA approval of all such issues before submitting the closing package to the SBA District Office. iv. Each CDC must issue a written opinion based upon financial statements current within 120 calendar days from the published Central Servicing Agent (CSA) Cut-Off Date for the applicable Debenture Funding Date that to the best of its knowledge there has been no unremedied substantial adverse change in the Applicant’s (or Operating Company’s) ability to repay the 504 loan since its submission of the loan application to SBA. This CDC opinion must be made within 14 business days prior to its request to SLPC to ship the file, and the CDC opinion must be supported by financial statements that are dated no earlier than 120 calendar days from the published CSA Cut-Off Date for the applicable Debenture Funding Date. v. For all 504 loans except ALP and PCLP, CDCs must provide its finding to the SLPC along with copies of the financial statements. The SLPC either will notify the CDC of its approval or, if SBA disagrees with the CDC’s determination of no unremedied substantial adverse change, the debenture will not close until SBA has been satisfied that any adverse change has been remedied. ALP and PCLP CDCs must submit the closing package to SBA counsel and retain the finding and copies of the financial statements on which they relied in their files. vi. If the debenture closing is not consummated in the month following the CDC’s opinion of no unremedied substantial adverse change, the CDC must prepare a new opinion and follow the same process described above if the financial statement supporting the opinion will be more than 120 days old when the CDC requests the file from the SLPC for closing.

Otherwise, the CDC must submit a new opinion to the SLPC in the same manner noted above. vii. Request that access to each E-Tran terms and conditions approval and all modifications be granted by the SLPC to the SBA counsel for closing in time to meet the SBA District Office’s deadline for submission of loan closing packages. CDCs must not request access to the E-Tran terms and conditions and modifications unless the debenture is ready for closing and sale during the month following the request. If access has not been granted to SBA counsel by its loan closing package submission deadline, SBA counsel may hold over the package for the next month’s debenture sale. viii. Electronically submit closing packages by the deadline established by SBA counsel. No late closing packages will be accepted. SBA counsel will hold late packages over for the next month’s debenture sale. ix. Use only the 504 Debenture Closing Checklist and submit documents in the order appearing on the Checklist. In the column labeled “CDC” on the Checklist, the CDC must check off each document the CDC has included in the closing package or for documents not applicable to a particular transaction, write “NA” in the block. CDC must submit only a copy of each document and must retain the original until SBA counsel completes their review. After the debenture sale, the CDC must retain a copy of the closing package in its files and make it available to SBA upon request. x. Hold all original loan documents until SBA gives the CDC written notification that SBA has completed its review of the closing package and approved the debenture sale. If SBA counsel determines that the loan is ready for funding, SBA counsel must notify the CDC and CSA that the debenture is ready for sale. If the SBA counsel determines that changes are needed in the closing documents, SBA must notify the CDC of such changes before the cut-off-date by which the CSA must receive documents from the CDC for the debenture sale. After the CDC makes the necessary changes and SBA has approved the changes, SBA must notify the CDC and CSA that the debenture is ready for sale. xi. Send by overnight mail to the CSA the necessary debenture closing documents for the debenture sale. After SBA sends the CDC notice of which debentures SBA has approved for sale, the CDC must send to the CSA by overnight mail the following debenture closing documents for each debenture to be sold: a) SBA Form 1506 , “Servicing Agent Agreement” (original); b) SBA Form 1504, “Development Company 504 Debenture” (original); c) SBA Form 1505, “Note (CDC/504 Loans)” (copy);", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_336_78347894", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Forward the original of all documents listed on SBA Form 2286 , “504 Debenture Closing Checklist,” (Checklist) (which serves as the original collateral listing) to the appropriate CLSC within 30 days after the debenture sale. a) The CDC must forward the collateral file containing all the original documents listed on the Checklist to the CLSC. The CDC must use the Checklist as the collateral listing. The CDC must maintain the collateral file in a manner acceptable to SBA. b) If the CDC has not yet received all original documents by 30 days after the debenture sale date, the CDC must send the documents it does have and must send additional documents along with a collateral listing upon receipt. xiii. Ensure that all recorded interim lender documents are canceled of record (officially canceled at the place of recordation, as required by law) within 90 days after funding. xiv. If a 504 loan is canceled after closing but before funding. Ensure that all recorded documents are canceled of record. b. SBA Counsel’s Responsibilities SBA Counsel Must: i. Issue an annual 504 debenture closing schedule with SBA District Office deadlines for receiving closing packages. SBA counsel responsible for debenture closing in each SBA District Office must make available an annual schedule of the deadlines for receipt of both regular and expedited closing packages for each monthly debenture sale to the public and to CDCs who regularly submit closing packages to the district. ii. Review closing packages. SBA counsel must use the standard Checklist to review the 8 documents submitted for an expedited closing and 13 documents submitted for a regular closing. If SBA counsel has concerns that SBA may be at material risk if the debenture is sold, then SBA counsel must contact the CDC and identify what information is reasonably necessary to address that concern. If the CDC is unable to provide the information or otherwise alleviate the concern, then the debenture will not be submitted for sale. In addition, SBA counsel must verify that the information the CDC entered onto the Debenture, Note, and Servicing Agent Agreement forms is accurate and complete.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_337_876763218", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Notify CDCs of deficiencies. SBA counsel may reject late packages or packages that do not meet the standards for debenture sale. If the SBA counsel determines that changes are needed in the closing documents of packages approved for sale, SBA counsel must notify the CDC of such changes before the deadline upon which the CDC must mail the documents to CSA for the debenture sale. If SBA counsel rejects a package, SBA counsel must notify the CDC that SBA will not include the package in the scheduled sale and advise the CDC in writing of what the CDC needs to correct for the package to meet the standards for sale. The CDC may resubmit the package for a future sale with the required changes. iv. If SBA counsel discovers an issue in reviewing the closing package that impacts closing of the loan, SBA counsel will advise the CDC and CDC Counsel. If the issue cannot be resolved, then SBA counsel will notify the Area Counsel of the issue, who will make a recommendation to OGC and OCA for a final decision. v. Issue an SBA counsel closing opinion. Once SBA counsel is satisfied with the loan closing package (including that the CDC has made all necessary changes to the closing documents as identified by SBA counsel), SBA counsel must issue an opinion pursuant to 13 CFR § 120.960(c) stating that the debenture may be closed, SBA may execute its guarantee, and the debenture may be sold. The SBA counsel’s Opinions should be sent to the SLPC. vi. Notify the CDC and the CSA which loans SBA has approved for debenture funding. SBA counsel must notify the CDC and the CSA in writing as to which debentures the SBA District Office approves for funding in that month’s sale. vii. Complete File Reviews (CFRs): SBA counsel must conduct a CFR of a random selection of all loan closings, whether those closing packages were submitted by Priority CDCs or non- Priority CDCs, to ensure program integrity. A Complete File Review consists of a review of the items listed on SBA Form 2303 , Checklist for Complete File Review.” The number and frequency of CFRs are at the discretion of SBA counsel, but no less than one package per 10 closing packages submitted by each CDC will be reviewed. SBA counsel will notify the CDC when a loan has been selected for a CFR, and the CDC must promptly submit to SBA counsel the applicable items on SBA Form 2303 for that loan. SBA counsel will prepare a written report documenting the CFR and its results, and send a copy of that report to: a) The CDC; b) The CDC’s 504 closing attorney that closed the loan; c) The SBA counsel that reviewed and opined upon the loan closing package; and", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_338_667041176", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

If the CFR reveals closing deficiencies that could result in a loss to SBA, the CDC and/or its closing attorney must promptly correct the deficiencies, if possible. SBA may take other action, including an action against the CDC closing attorney as described in Para. I. above. In the event of a loss, SBA may pursue an action against the CDC under 13 CFR 120.938(b) . c. Central Servicing Agent’s (CSA) Responsibilities The CSA must: i. Review debenture closing documents, package and price debenture for sale, and conduct debenture sale. The CSA notifies the CDC of any changes that need to be made or additional information to be provided before the debenture sale can occur. ii. Complete the Servicing Agent Agreement and Note: The CSA fills in the remaining blanks on the Note and Servicing Agent Agreement, generating conformed pages, and executes the Servicing Agent Agreement. iii. Distribute post-closing documents. The CSA will provide the following documents online: a) The first page of the Note; b) The Note amortization and prepayment schedules; and c) Pages 3 and 4 of the Servicing Agent Agreement. d. Trustee’s Responsibilities The Trustee will provide copies of the Debenture and the Debenture amortization and prepayment schedules to the CDC, CSA, or SBA, as directed. 7. Debenture Pools Neither a Borrower nor an Associate of the Borrower may purchase an interest in a Debenture Pool in which the Debenture that funded its 504 loan has been placed. ( 13 CFR § 120.939) 8. Post-Disbursement Issues A CDC may request changes on disbursed 504 loans by contacting the appropriate SBA CLSC. i. Guidance on loan servicing is outlined in SOP 50 55, “504 Loan Servicing and Liquidation.” CDCs may not unilaterally approve any adjustment to or change in the ownership of a Borrower, including a change in percentage of ownership, for 12 months after final disbursement on any loan. ii. 13 CFR Part 120, subpart E outlines requirements under SBA loan servicing, liquidation, and debt collection litigation.

Assuming SBA will finance 35% of the project costs for 20 or 25 years, participation in project financing would be as follows: % Participation Amount 50% Third-Party Lender $500,000 35% 504 Net Debenture $350,000 15% Small Business ji $150,000 100% Total Project Costs $1,000,000 B. STEPS TO CALCULATE THE GROSS DEBENTURE Use the following step by step pricing model procedures to determine the administrative costs and the Gross Debenture amount. Except for the underwriting fee and closing costs, each administrative cost is based on the amount of the Net Debenture. For more information, see Chapter 1, Para. C.12 of this Section, Eligible Administrative Costs . Also see Section A, Ch. 4, Para. E., 504 Loan Program Fees and Use of Agents. 1 Net Debenture Determine the Net Debenture: $350,000 2 SBA Guaranty Fee (.5%) multiply $350,000 by 0.005 = $1,750 3 Funding Fee (.25%) multiply $350,000 by .0025 = $875 4 CDC Processing Fee (1.5%) multiply $350,000 by .015 = $5,250 5 Eligible Closing Costs* = $2,500 6 Gross Debenture Amount To calculate the Gross Debenture, add items 1 through 5 above and divide the total by 0.996 for 20 or 25-year debentures (for 10-year debentures, this number would be 0.99625). This step adds the Underwriter’s Fee to the total debenture. Round this number up to the next even thousand. Net Debenture Proceeds $350,000 SBA Guaranty Fee $1,750 Funding Fee $875", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_341_54350419", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

The CDC’s Processing Fee and the closing costs are the only fees that can be paid upfront and deleted from the Gross Debenture calculations. 2. If the Borrower chooses to pay the CDC’s Processing Fee upfront, the Borrower may be reimbursed for the CDC’s Processing Fee from the debenture proceeds. If the Borrower is reimbursed, the CDC’s Processing Fee will be included in calculating the Gross Debenture. The CDC will receive the fee as usual. The CDC then must reimburse the Borrower. If the Borrower does not want to be reimbursed for the CDC’s Processing Fee from the debenture proceeds, the Gross Debenture calculation must include the CDC’s Processing Fee in order to determine the correct Underwriter’s Fee. Once the Underwriter’s Fee is calculated, a zero is then entered on the CDC’s Processing Fee line in the SBA Form 1506, and the dollar amounts are re-totaled and rounded to the next higher thousand for the new Gross Debenture amount. CDC Processing Fee $5,250 Closing Costs $2,500 Total $360,375 Divide by 0.99600 (0.99625 for 10-Year Debenture) $360,065 Round up to the next even thousand $362,000 The Gross Debenture in this example is $ 362,000. Note: The Gross Debenture is calculated first because the Underwriter’s Fee is based on the Gross Debenture, not the Net Debenture. 7 Underwriter’s Fee To determine the exact amount of the underwriter’s fee, multiply the 20 or 25-year Gross Debenture by .004 (for 10-year debentures, this number would be .00375). Multiply $362,000 by .004 = $1,448 8 Balance to Borrower. The difference between the Gross Debenture amount ($362,000.00) and the sum of Net Debenture proceeds ($350,000.00), processing and closing fees ($8,625.00), and Underwriter’s fee ($1,448.00) goes to the Borrower. In this example, the Balance to Borrower is: $362,000 – ($350,000 + $10,375 + $1,448) = $931.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_342_351203810", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

A Debenture is priced at time of application. If there are any changes in the 504 portion of the project costs between loan approval and project completion, the Debenture must be re- priced. 2. If the Borrower does not use the full amount of any contingency fund, then the Debenture may be re-priced as follows: If the amount of the unused contingency fund is 2% or less of the approved Gross Debenture amount, the difference must be refunded to the Borrower from the Gross Debenture proceeds by the CSA. No change is needed in the Debenture amount, and this does not require a loan modification request. If the amount of the unused contingency fund is greater than 2% of the approved Gross Debenture amount, the CDC must request a loan modification from the SLPC prior to closing to reduce the Net Debenture Proceeds by the amount of the unused contingency fund, and the Debenture amount is recalculated. ( 13 CFR § 120.930(c)) E. FUNDING THE DEBENTURE The 504 Debentures are normally sold and proceeds disbursed on the Wednesday after the second Sunday of each month. The Fiscal Agent normally negotiates the final rate and fees with underwriters on the Tuesday after the first Sunday of each month. F. DISBURSEMENT OF DEBENTURE PROCEEDS On the scheduled sale date, the Gross Debenture proceeds, less the Underwriter’s Fee, will be wired to the CSA. Upon receipt of the proceeds, the CSA must: 1. Deduct an amount sufficient to cover the following: Its initiation fee as computed and identified by SBA in the Servicing Agent Agreement, if applicable (not presently applicable); and A guaranty fee payable to SBA, as in effect at the time of loan approval. 2. Disburse the balance of the proceeds within 48 hours of receipt of funds as follows: Payoff the interim lender of the Net Debenture amount; CDC’s Processing Fee; and Balance to Borrower based on the CSA’s computations under the pricing model.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_343_105822017", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": true}

Additionally, SBA requires that all Phase I ESAs contain a conclusion by the Environmental Professional that performs the assessment that either: (1) the risk of Contamination at the Property is so minimal that no further investigation is warranted; or (2) there is risk sufficient to warrant additional investigation. Alternatively, the Environmental Professional may include a similar statement to this effect. If further investigation is warranted, the Environmental Professional should provide a detailed description of the recommendation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets forth time frames for the viability of Phase I ESAs (See 40 CFR § 312.20.) For SBA’s purposes, and notwithstanding the EPA’s regulations on updating Phase I ESAs after 180 days, SBA will accept for review an otherwise AAI compliant Phase I ESA if it was completed within 1 year of the date upon which it was submitted to an SBA loan processing center as part of an Environmental Investigation. Lenders or CDCs using their delegated authority may accept for review an otherwise AAI compliant Phase I ESA if it was performed within 1 year of the date of approval of its Environmental Investigation. Parties may still wish to strictly comply with EPA’s regulatory timeframes to avoid jeopardizing legal and regulatory protections. Note: The immediately preceding paragraph does not apply to liquidation situations under SOP 50 55 or SOP 50 57. “Phase II Environmental Site Assessment” (Phase II ESA) means an Environmental Investigation, which at a minimum, is conducted by an Environmental Professional in accordance with the most recently adopted standard for a Phase II ESA process established by ASTM International, currently ASTM E1903-97 (2002). SBA will recognize a Phase II ESA conducted in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards of practice and consisting of a scope of work that would be considered reasonable and sufficient to identify the presence, nature, and extent of a Release. “Property” means any interest in commercial real estate upon which a security interest such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or leasehold deed of trust is required as collateral for a loan or debenture. “Records Search with Risk Assessment” means and includes (1) a search of the government databases identified in 40 CFR § 312.26 for an AAI compliant Phase I as well as a search of historical use sources (for example, aerial photography, city directories, reverse directories and/or fire insurance maps) pertaining to the Property and Adjoining Properties; and (2) a risk assessment by an Environmental Professional based on the results of the records search as to whether the Property is either “low risk” or “elevated risk” or “high risk” for Contamination. While the choice of standard historical sources to be reviewed on any particular site is at the discretion of the Environmental Professional in their professional judgment, the historical sources should identify property uses back to the property’s first developed use, or back to 1940, whichever is earlier. The Environmental Professional need only review as many of the standard historical sources as are necessary, reasonably ascertainable, and likely to be useful.

The Environmental Investigation requirements set forth below apply to all loans secured by a l ien or security interest on real property (a fee simple or leasehold mortgage, deed of trust, etc.) or personal property (gas station fixtures or equipment such as tanks, pumps, lines, etc.) currently used to operate a gas station or commercial fueling facility (\"Gas Station Loans\"). These requirements would not apply when the applicant operates a business, such as a convenience store associated with a gas station, in which the applicant only leases the real or personal property and neither the real nor personal property is used as collateral for the loan. Nor do these requirements apply to situations where the only collateral for the loan is something other than gas station equipment (for example, food inventory, shelving, etc.). A. Environmental Site Assessment. The Environmental Investigation for all Gas Station Loans (including those secured by gas station equipment only) must: 1. Begin with a Phase I ESA with the additional requirement that it be conducted by an independent Environmental Professional; 2. Include an analysis of all relevant environmental records concerning the Property and Adjoining Properties, including any records provided by the seller if the loan is to purchase the Property; 3. Include documentation supporting the Environmental Professional’s determination of compliance with all regulatory requirements, if any, pertaining to tank and equipment testing (see paragraph B. below) (even if the loan is secured by real property); 4. Include the results of any further investigation, which may include a Phase II, recommended by the Environmental Professional (Any Phase II performed in connection with a Gas Station Loan must be conducted by an independent Environmental Professional who holds a current Professional Engineer’s or Professional Geologist’s license and has the equivalent of 3 years of full time relevant experience.); and 5. If the Property is Contaminated, include a detailed description of and cost estimate for the recommended Remediation. B. The Environmental Investigation performed by the Environmental Professional must include a determination whether the gas station is in compliance with all regulatory requirements, if any, pertaining to tank and equipment testing. A loan may not be disbursed until full compliance is achieved. Further, any leaking or otherwise defective equipment, systems, containment devices, etc., must be replaced or repaired prior to disbursement. C.

If the Environmental Professional concludes that the Property is not Contaminated, the SBA Lender (except on PLP, SBA Express, Export Express, and PCLP loans) must submit the results of the Environmental Investigation to SBA with recommendations and seek SBA’s concurrence. 7. Property is Contaminated. If the Environmental Professional concludes that the Property is Contaminated, the SBA Lender can either: Decline the loan; or Follow the requirements in Section A, Ch. 5, Para. E.5, Property Contamination or Remediation,” provided that at a minimum, in change of ownership situations, the SBA Indemnification Agreement as described in Section A, Chapter 6, E.6.d.i, Indemnification, must always be obtained and signed by the seller.

Waivers may be sought from the SBA Environmental Committee at EnvironmentalAppeals@sba.gov on a case-by-case basis. A mere unwillingness on the part of a seller to execute the indemnification agreement is not a sufficient basis for a waiver. PLP, SBA Express, and Export Express Lenders and PCLP CDCs do not have the authority to grant a waiver and are also required to follow this procedure.) In addition, prudent lending practices may require an SBA Lender to utilize some of the other listed mitigating factors such as requiring additional collateral. D. When Waiver and Release of Right to Indemnification from SBA/ SBA Lender Required. If any oil company or other Person (as defined in Appendix 4) has a right to indemnification from subsequent owners of the Property (e.g., SBA/SBA Lender after acquiring Property through foreclosure or other means), then they must execute either the SBA Indemnification Agreement or another document in which they waive all known and unknown rights and release all claims and causes of action whether now or hereafter in existence against SBA and SBA Lender related to Contamination at the Property including the right to indemnification. The document containing the waiver and release must be recorded. Lenders and CDCs, except when submitting requests through PLP, SBA Express and Export Express, must submit all waiver and releases to the SBA center processing the loan for review and approval by SBA counsel, along with a copy of the title report, the document providing for indemnification, and the purchase and sale documents, if any.

Electronic signatures include digital signatures. B. ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE ELIGIBLE DOCUMENTS: 1. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, SBA Lenders may use electronic signatures on the documents referenced below (collectively referred to as “Eligible Documents”), provided that the signatories comply with the standards outlined in this Notice. Electronic signatures cannot be used on any document identified below if the recording office requires wet ink signatures. Application Documents: Electronic signatures may be accepted on all documents requiring signatures. Loan Closing Documents: Electronic signatures may be accepted on all documents requiring signatures.

C. VENDOR/TECHNOLOGY SELECTION REQUIREMENTS: An SBA Lender must ensure that any electronic signature technology vendor it uses: 1. Complies with Section 101 of the ESIGN Act; 2. Has the experience, capabilities, and expected longevity to meet all SBA electronic signature requirements; 3. Includes vendor agreements that contain express provisions that vendors will comply with all applicable SBA requirements pertaining to this Appendix; 4. Includes vendor agreements language that would ensure that vendor representatives will be available to provide testimony to support the United States government in litigation regarding electronic signature data that will be introduced in court; 5.

LENDER LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO ADHERE TO PRESCRIBED STANDARDS: The Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) will review compliance with the ESIGN Act as well as standards outlined in this Appendix as components of its oversight of SBA Lenders. As with all Loan Program Requirements, SBA Lenders may be held accountable for not complying with the electronic signature standards and requirements set forth in this Appendix. E. QUALITY CONTROL: SBA Lenders must ensure their electronic signature policies and procedures meet all requirements including their own oversight of the electronic signature process. F. RECORD RETENTION: SBA’s record retention requirements are the same for both wet ink and electronic signatures (see Appendix 11, Record Retention Requirements ). When wet signatures are obtained on original hard copies, the SBA Lender must maintain the hard copy with wet signature in its loan file. For records signed electronically, the audit trail as well as any computer systems (including hardware and software), controls, and documentation must be readily available for, and subject to, SBA inspection for the same periods as records signed in wet ink. An SBA Lender’s system must be able to reproduce electronic records as accurately as if they were paper when printed or viewed. These records must be made available to SBA on request.", "id": "SOP_50_10_7_1_415_875959754", "file": "SOP_50_10_7_1.pdf", "title": "SOP_50_10_7_1", "url": "", "effective": "unknown", "scope": "unknown", "boost_504": false}
